/k/ /g/ because by replacing /k/ with /g/ in a given segment, the meaning can change; e. g., kukanya (to increase) and kuganya (to be miserable).
/t/ /d/, for example: Such examples as obuta and kukanya are said to constitute "minimal pairs".
n-dora (I see).
/p/ h These two sounds, which are far removed from each other from the articulatory point of view, are otherwise quite close in Runyakitara.
p p is often aspirated as ph.
p p such as in [ phaasi ] (flat iron) and [okup h akuka] (to do something hurriedly).
p p as a sound on its own is rather rare, both in Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga.
h h, on the other hand, occurs very frequently both in Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga.
m m, it is pronounced p.
b β β is a very frequent sound in Runyakitara but b is not.
b b usually occurs when preceded by the nasal m, in loan-words or in onomatopoeic words.
b b preceded by m
v v, on the other hand, is not frequent in Runyakitara.
t,d,ts t,d,ts and s
t t usually has two variations.
t t, which is the most frequent one, and the alveolar t.t
t t.
t t '.
t t and alveolar t
t t is used predominantly.
t t is widespread.
t t, we note that the overwhelming majority of Runyakitara speakers have d
d d pronounced as an apico-alveolar and practically never as a dental.
ts ts sound, on the other hand, is not widely used in Runyakitara.
ts ts sound is replaced either by s
s s or ky
ky ky or hy
hy hy.
ts ts in Rutooro could be heard particularly among the youth in words such as:
I,f,Y I,f,Y, and rr
rr rr These sounds are very frequent in Runyakitara particularly [f].
l l is most common among Runyoro-Rutooro speakers who, at the same time, use [r]
[r] [r] even more frequently.
rr rr, on the other hand, or the rolled r
r r, is most common among Rutooro speakers, although it is heard under different variations throughout the area under study, especially in Ankore.
r r, it will be noted that throughout the Runyakitara area, it is usually pronounced flapped /f/, such that the following will be pronounced thus:
f f, as a fricative sound and not flapped f.
[l] [l], it can be said that this is practically non-existent among Runyankore speakers.
[l] [l] is used as in RunyoroRutooro although many Bakiga believe they do not have it simply because it is not in the Runyankore-Rukiga orthography.
r r in determined environments (in the same manner as in Rukiga).
l l is attested when it is preceded by a,o
a,o, or u
u u and followed by i
i i or e
e e.
r r.
a a morphological or word boundary or not.
I I
f f
f f and l
l l appear in complementary distribution; that is, the sounds appearing before and after l
l l are different from those appearing before and after f
f f.
f f, as in i….i
i….i, like omubiri (body), pronounced [omubifi] or e….e
e….e, like ekikere
(Rn/Rt) (Rn/Rt) (frog), pronounced [ekikefe] and many other possible environments.
l l and f
f f appearing at word initial, have different conditions of appearance; for example:
r r or rr
rr rr - also called a trill - is concerned, as mentioned earlier, it is most widely used among the Rutooro speakers but can also be found in other cases.
rr rr is clearly distinctive as can be attested by the following examples:
rr rr in Rutooro is translated.
r r such that the equivalent of the Rutooro omurro (fire) would be omuriro.
r r is almost rolled as in Rutooro but then there is a slight vowel that separates the rolling of r
r r (or doubling in orthography).
r r is clearly rolled but the difference between this pronunciation and that of Rutooro is that the vowel preceding the rolled r
r r is lengthened in Rutooro.
r r or [r]
[r] [r] is heard in Runyoro and Rutooro but in different conditions.
r r or [f] is often pronounced as [r]
[r] [r], like in omunyoro [omunoro] rather than [omunofo]; that is, as [r]
[r] [r].
r r or rr
rr rr such that instead of [omuurro] (fire), one sometimes hears [omuиr].
fvfv fvfv structure is concerned, the rolled r
r r in Rutooro and Runyankore and the flapped f in Runyoro have reached the highest stage of simplification from a historical point of view.
{f∼f∨fv} {f∼f∨fv} but has undergone change to {fvfv}
{fvfv} {fvfv}.
l,f,rr l,f,rr and r
r r, it should be noted that the above sounds are pronounced as d
d d when preceded by the alveolar nasal n
n n.
rr rr, only the first r
r r becomes d
d d while the second r
r r remains r
r r.
J and 3 These two sounds are very frequent in Runyankore-Rukiga but of very limited use in Runyoro-Rutooro.
f f is usually written a sh in Runyankore-Rukiga orthography while 3 is written as j
j j.
f f is very limited in Runyoro-Rutooro although heard among older generations and 3 is non-existent there.
J J, the following examples are for Runyoro-Rutooro.
h h, the form used in spellings.
h h can be replaced by f
f f or s
s s by some speakers.
h h and not f
f f or s
s s.
f f and s
s s, therefore, only appear when h
h h is followed by the palatal continuant y
y y.
h h is maintained.
hy hy in Runyoro-Rutooro is more complex than is shown in the chart above.
hy hy, which is close to a velar fricative +y
+y +y, something like: omuXyo (the sound often heard among some Basoga speakers, in Lumasaba or in Luluya).
h h totally dropped; omufyo could also be heard among some.
w w and y
y y
w w and y
y y may also play the role of full consonants in the CVCV syllable structure such as:
w w here is used fully as a consonant followed by a vowel, thus respecting the usual Bantu structure of CVCV.
w w are fairly rare in Runyakitara.
w w is replaced by h
h h.
y y falls in well with the usual structure of CVCV as shown in the following examples:
f f and 3 are to be found in abundance in Runyankore-Rukiga.
f f in RunyoroRutooro is s
s s, that of 3 is j
j j as shown in the following examples:
zh zh ' would have better represented the sound 3 in Runyankore-Rukiga orthography than the present j
j j and would have corresponded to sh, which represents the unvoiced.
j j ' is more representative of the sound [j]
[j] [j].
c,j,ky c,j,ky and gy
gy gy The palatal sounds c
c c and j
j j are frequent in Runyakitara.
k k and g
g g.
c c and j
j j used as distinct sounds: (a)
c c and j
j j in Runyoro-Rutooro is straight forward and does not need much explanation.
c c and j
j j are used in all environments without exception.
c c are similar to those in Runyoro-Rutooro, the rest of the examples show marked differences.
k k ' is pronounced as c
c c and ' g
g g ' as j
j j when they are followed by i
i i or y
y y.
k k ' or ' g
g g ' are followed by e
e e, they are usually written with ' y
y y ' as ' ky
ky ky ' or ' gy
gy gy ' to show palatalisation.
e e following ' k
k k ' or ' g
g g ' does not bring about palatalisation.
k+i k+i or g+i
g+i g+i, however, the letter ' y
y y ' is omitted to show palatalisation.
i i occurs before ' k
k k ' or ' g
g g ', palatalization automatically occurs.
y y.
k k ' or ' g
g g ' is followed by e
e e, there is no palatalisation.
k k or g
g g and the next morpheme.
ky ky and gy
gy gy are usually not heard.
k k and g
g g has some variations.
[kv] [k v ] and [gv]
[g v ], that is, k
k k and g
g g, with a slight y
y y.
ky ky and gy
gy gy can also be applied to the pronunciation of ki
ki ki and gi
gi gi, which are pronounced as full palatals by Rukiga speakers and many Runyankore speakers but as palatalised velars by a few Runyankore speakers.
w w and y
y y
w w and y
y y are usually called, in phonetics, frictionless continuants or approximants.
w w, palate for y
y y ) neither come in real contact (as in the case of consonants) nor are they totally separated from each other (as in the case of vowels).
w w and y
y y usually play the role of semi-consonants in such compounds as:
ei,oi ei,oi and ai
ai ai for Ry/Rk
Ry/Rk Ry/Rk, and oi
oi oi and ai for
ai ai for Rn/Rt
Rn/Rt Rn/Rt.
ei ei is often used as a class prefix, where, in Rutooro, the prefix i
i i is used:
ai‾ ai ​ is often pronounced as ei‾
ei ​ :
ei ei seems to be restricted to the presence of the reflexible −e
−e −e - in the verb:
oi oi is frequent, particularly in Runyoro-Rutooro:
p,b,β,m p,b,β,m and w.b
w.b w.b and β
β β are usually said to be variants of the same phoneme, as follows:
b b and β
β β are in complementary distribution, with b
b b occurring after a nasal and β
β β elsewhere, as shown in the following examples:
b b and β
β β are conditional variants of the same phoneme, or allophones.
b b and β
β β are free variants in the following areas: In loan words, one usually finds b
b b.
β β and b
b b when they appear at the beginning of a sentence, for example:
β/b β/b can be considered as distinct phonemes because there exists at least one minimal pair:
β β and b
b b as conditional or full variants.
p/b/p/ p/b/p/ and /b/(orβ)
/b/(orβ) /b/(orβ) are usually distinct phonemes as shown below:
/m/ /m/ is also a distinct phoneme as in: (ku)
βamba βamba to crucify (e) mamba type of fish (eki)
βuga βuga town (eki) muga disabled person
/w/ /w/ This sound has a problem as far as its phonemic status is concerned.
w w is a phoneme in Runyakitara .
/f/ /f/ and /v/
/v/ /v/ are phonemes of the language.
(Rn/Rt) (Rn/Rt) wine ediini religion
t,d,ts,n,l,f,rr,Y,s,z,∫ t,d,ts,n,l,f,rr,Y,s,z,∫ and 3 .
t t and the alveolar t
t t are free variants of the same phoneme.
t t is the most common among the Runyakitara speakers while the alveolar t
t t is mostly restricted among the Runyoro speakers.
t t or the alveolar t
t t, is a distinct phoneme as exemplified by the following minimal pairs:
/t/ /t/ and /d/
/d/ /d/ are distinct phonemes.
ts ts is not a distinct phoneme since it occurs in free variation with s
s s.
s s.
/s/ /s/ can be a distinct phoneme as attested in the following examples:
/n/ is also a distinct phoneme:
l l and r
r r are conditional variants and in Runyoro-Rutooro, we indicated the environments in which the two occur.
/r/ /r/ as the basic phoneme (with the variant l
l l ).
/rr/ /rr/, it can be considered as a distinct phoneme.
/rr/ /rr/ include (particularly in Rutooro):
/s/ and /z/ are also distinct phonemes.
ts ts is a free variant of s
s s, but elsewhere /s/ can be attested as a phoneme.
/f/ /f/ is a distinct phoneme in RunyankoreRukiga.
/3/ /3/ is also a distinct phoneme in Runyankore-Rukiga.
∫ ∫ is a free variant of h
h h and s
s s as in omuhyo or omu§yo or omusyo (a knife).
∫ ∫ and 3 are attested to include:
s s and ∫
∫ ∫ are distinct phonemes at least in Runyankore-Rukiga, there are sometimes tendencies to use s
s s instead of ∫
∫ ∫ as free variants of the same phoneme among some of the native speakers as in the following examples:
c,j,ny,y,k,g,ky c,j,ny,y,k,g,k y
y y and gy
g y
y y and we include here the glottal h./c/
h./c/ h./c/ and /j/
/j/ /j/ are distinct phonemes in both Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga, but as we have already seen, they can also be conditional variants of k
k k and g
g g when the latter appear before i
i i and y
y y.
/c/ /c/ and /j/
/j/ /j/ and n
n n can be found in the following minimal pairs.
/n/ /n/ and /y/
/y/ /y/ are also phonemes in Runyakitara as in:
/k/ /k/ and /g/
/g/ /g/ are distinct phonemes in Runyakitara but, as we have already seen, among some Runyankore speakers, the conditional variants ky
k y
y y and gy
g y
y y can be used.
/k/ /k/ and /g/
/g/ /g/ as distinct phonemes can be seen in the following minimal pairs:
/h/ /h/ is also a distinct phoneme.
w w and y
y y compounds; for example:
/rr/ /rr/, which Runyankore-Rukiga does not have, the latter has two phonemes, /J/
/J/ /J/ and /3/
/3/ /3/, which Runyoro-Rutooro does not have.

You may wonder what Runyakitara stands for. If you are a Ugandan, you may think that some linguists sat down and came up with a new language that they then named Runyakitara. We are going to show you that this is not the case. Runyakitara, as a matter of fact, is a name that was proposed in the mid-1990s by language academics at Makerere University when they were introducing the teaching of Runyoro-Rutooro and RunyankoreRukiga as a degree-level course at that university. Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga are taught as one subject at the university and it was, therefore, convenient to give them one name because it evokes the old empire of Bunyoro-Kitara, which, at its height, covered most of the areas where Runyakitara is spoken today. The speakers of Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga, additionally, to a large extent understand each other and do not need an interpreter when conversing among themselves. According to some studies (Ladefoged, 1972), the languages or dialects have a high degree of mutual intelligibility.", "category": "Grammar"}

The latter itself belongs to the Niger-Congo which is under the Congo-Kordofan (also called Niger-Kordofan) language family. One notes that the Bantu language family is, geographically, the most widespread, stretching from the Equator to the Cape of Good Hope.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Runyakitara in the national context", "completion": "The Ugandan Constitution does not mention the word Runyakitara. It mentions 56 languages according to the tribes that the constitution recognises. Thus, Runyoro is recognised as a language in the same way Rukiga, Rutagwenda, Runyaruguru and others are. The practice in previous periods, particularly from the 1950s, was to recognise six area languages, at least for educational purposes, those that were to be taught in primary schools. These were: Luganda, Runyoro-Rutooro, Lwo, AtesoNgakarimojong, Lugbara and Runyankore-Rukiga. Thus, Runyakitara had two of its major varieties recognised among the six area languages of Uganda. The situation has now changed, with more languages, such as Lusoga, Japadhola, Lumasaaba and Lhukonzo being taught in primary schools and used as media of instruction during the first three years of primary education.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Language and Dialect", "completion": "Generally speaking, a language is made up of dialects; that is, different ways in which a language is used by speakers. The most widely-spoken dialects are the regional dialects; that is, people in a given area speaking a language somewhat differently from those of another area. There are also social dialects whereby people of a given class speak the language somewhat differently from those of another. Because of their high degree of mutual intelligibility, Runyoro, Rutooro, Runyankore and Rukiga could be considered as regional dialects of a language called Runyakitara. However, mutual intelligibility is not necessarily sufficient to bring different language varieties together to form one language. There are other factors to be considered which may be political and historical. For instance, the Danish language is very close to and mutually intelligible with one of the dialects of the Norwegian language. And yet Norwegian and Danish are considered as distinct languages because of historical factors. In the same manner, the kingdoms of Ankore, Bunyoro and Tooro have existed for more than a century and people came to associate the language type they spoke with the kingdom where they lived. So, the people of Bunyoro spoke Runyoro, which has a lot in common with Rutooro while those of Ankore spoke Runyankore which also has a lot in common with Rukiga. Furthermore, the different speakers of these four \"languages\" were aware that they could understand each other easily but in their own perception, they were speaking different languages. So, it is not enough for a few academicians to propose a name. It must also be accepted by the different speakers of the languages in question and eventually by the wider community. The use of the word Runyakitara is for the moment at crossroads with a possibility that it might eventually be widely accepted or that it might not. The example of the Chinese language is also most edifying. It is said that Chinese has many dialects some of which are mutually unintelligible. The most prominent dialects are Mandarin in the Northern part of China and Cantonese in the Southern part. These two major dialects are said not to be mutually intelligible. However, because of the long history of China as a nation, the two are recognized as forming one Chinese language with Mandarin being considered as the standard for the whole country. All the other dialects are also considered as being part of the Chinese language. The situation of Chinese is, however, facilitated by the script that is used. In effect, people with mutually unintelligible dialects can read and understand each other because of the nature of the Chinese script. The symbols of the Chinese script represent meanings of concepts rather than sounds and that is why people of different dialects can read and understand each other while being unable to hold a conversation together.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Historical Perspectives and Geographical Distribution", "completion": "It is widely accepted in Western Uganda, that a people's language or orulimi/orurimi corresponds to what her ethnic group speaks. The Banyoro speak Runyoro, the Batooro speak Rutooro, the Bagangaizi speak Rugangaizi, the Banyankore speak Runyankore, the Bakiga speak Rukiga, and so on. However, when the European missionaries came, those with interest in language noticed that most of the languages in Western Uganda were highly mutually intelligible. Those who wrote the first grammars and the Bible called those languages Runyoro because of the influence that the Empire of Bunyoro-Kitara had once had in this area. Thus, Maddox wrote the Elementary Lunyoro Grammar in 1902 and pointed out that he was writing a grammar of a language spoken far beyond the Bunyoro-Kitara Kingdom of the time. It is this language that we have called Runyakitara. In that respect, mutually intelligible languages or dialects that make up Runyakitara would include but would not be limited to the following: a) Runyankore, to which should be associated sub-dialects such as Ruhima, Ruhororo, Runyaruguru, Rutagwenda and to some extent Rukooki. b) Rukiga, to which should be associated such sub-dialects as Runyaifo, Runyangyezi, Rusigi, Ruhimba, Rugyeri, Ruheesi, and Runyabutumbi. c) Runyoro, to which should be associated such sub-dialects as Ruruuli, Runyara, and Rugangaizi. d) Rutooro, to which should be associated such sub-dialects as, Rusongora, Rutuku, Runyakyaka and Orutooro rwa Hansozi. There is also Lubwisi which could be considered as a sub-dialect of Rutooro. The above form the Runyakitara group in Uganda. Outside Uganda, we have in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ruhuma, which is clearly a sub-dialect of Rutooro as well as Ruhema; in Tanzania we have Runyambo, Ruhaya and Kerewe. One should note that the first Bible for Western Uganda was written in what the writers called Runyoro in 1913, whose target audience went far beyond the borders of the Bunyoro-Kitara kingdom. It was read in the whole of Western Uganda until the first and full Runyankore-Rukiga Bible came out in 1964. It is only in the mid 1950's that the umbrella word Runyoro lost value and it was agreed at different meetings that Runyankore-Rukiga would be considered as one language and Runyoro-Rutooro as another. The name Runyakitara is therefore, convenient for this book in as far as we are addressing commonalities and differences existing in the structure of four mutually intelligible dialects or languages, depending on one's perception.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: General theoretical approach", "completion": "This book is intended for a wide readership, ranging from students in secondary schools and teacher training colleges to language teachers at all levels of education. It should also be useful for language students and lecturers in institutions of higher learning as well as researchers in languages and related areas. Due to the nature of the readership, language theories are applied sparingly in as far as they facilitate the understanding of a given language aspect by the reader. For instance, the diagrams are used to analyse some types of sentences but the authors will not go into detailed analysis of transformational generative grammar. The authors of various chapters have adopted a descriptive approach in their analysis. In that respect, a language element is analysed by taking into account its relationship with other elements in the language, the role it plays vis-à-vis the rest, and the meaning that it carries. Furthermore, since we are dealing with four major varieties of Runyakitara, a comparative approach is imperative. To that end, similar characteristics of a given point are highlighted and the differences are also demonstrated. In giving examples, the authors, in most chapters, have endeavoured to indicate whether the example is in Runyankore-Rukiga (Ry/Rk) or Runyoro-Rutooro (Rn/Rt). Where there is no specific indication, one will assume that the example is common to all the four varieties. Otherwise, for the chapters based only on one of the two major varieties, Runyankore-Rukiga or Runyoro-Rutooro, that will be indicated at the beginning of the chapter. Regarding some specific topics, such as those on translation, discourse analysis, semantics and lexicography, theories and approaches pertaining to them are explained within their respective chapters. Finally, it should be pointed out that this book is varied enough to enable readers with different interests to concentrate on the chapter or chapters that are of interest to them. For further reading on Runyakitara, the reader is advised to look out for two more publications, namely The Cultures of the Banyakitara and Runyakitara Literature by the same group of authors.

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Introduction", "completion": "This chapter, which is an updated version of Ndoleriire's (1992) article, endeavours to present aspects of the phonetics and phonology of Runyakitara. Some people have already made an attempt but very often in a very superficial manner. The studies that exist are presenting sounds either in Runyoro-Rutooro or Runyankore-Rukiga. No serious attempt seems to have been made to examine whether there is an underlying phonological system of the four major Runyakitara varieties spoken in Uganda (Runyoro, Rutooro, Runyankore, and Rukiga). This is precisely what we set out to do.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Theoretical Framework", "completion": "In the inventory of sounds, the approach will be purely descriptive, the aim being to try to account for as many sounds as can be identified in the four dialects of Runyakitara (Runyoro-Rutooro/Runyankore-Rukiga, sometimes divided into Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga). This collection of sounds is what we have referred to as the phonetics of Runyakitara. After the inventory of the sounds, an attempt will be made to determine the 'functional' or 'distinctive' units among them; that is what we usually call 'phonemes'. This functional description of sounds is called 'phonology'. In order to identify the phonemes of Runyakitara, we shall essentially base our analysis on a 'functional/distributional' framework. In the Prague school sense of the word (Vachek, 2008), a sound is 'functional' if, in a given segment, it can help in differentiating one word from another. For instance, in Runyakitara, /k/ /k/ is a distinct phoneme from /g/ /g/ because by replacing /k/ /k/ with /g/ /g/ in a given segment, the meaning can change; e. g., kukanya (to increase) and kuganya (to be miserable). In the same manner, /t/ /t/ is said to be a distinct phoneme from /d/ /d/, for example: Such examples as obuta and kukanya are said to constitute \"minimal pairs\". The notion of minimal pairs, as explained by Ndoleriire (1980), is very useful in phonology for determining the distinctive features of sounds; that is, their phonemic status. Another important yardstick in determining whether a sound is a phoneme or not is to examine its distribution. By distribution, we mean the physical environment of the sound; what appears on its left and right. This often determines the physical representation of the sound itself. For instance, in a good number of Bantu languages, the sound [r] is pronounced as [d] when it is preceded by a nasal such as [n]. Thus, in Runyoro-Rutooro, oku-rora (to see) becomes n n-dora (I see). The [d] is brought about by the preceding nasal [n]. In this case, we say that [r] and [n] in the environment of ku-rora/n-dora, are not two distinct phonemes, but variants of one phoneme. Their physical representation is determined by specific environments; that is, the presence or absence of the nasal [n].", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Scope of the Study", "completion": "Here, we are going to analyse some aspects of the Runyakitara phonetics and phonology especially from the segmental point of view. This means that our study will not be comprehensive since Runyakitara is made up of numerous dialects and sub-dialects, not to talk of 'idiolects' or individual varieties. A comprehensive study would therefore attempt to account for the sub-systems attestable in the different dialects. This will not be the case; we shall limit ourselves to the most frequent pronunciations among the speakers of Runyoro, Rutooro, Runyankore and Rukiga. This means that, besides other Runyakitara dialects such as Ruhororo, Rutagwenda, Runyaruguru, Rusongora, Rutuku, Rugangaizi and Lubwisi, even the major dialects will not be thoroughly analysed since only the most common pronunciations will be dealt with. Since we are mainly dealing with segmental phonetics and phonology, that is, the study of the sounds that appear at the level of the basic sound itself, such as \\grave{o}-m u ́-n-t u ́ (Rn/Rt) (Rn/Rt) (a person) without putting into consideration such other aspects as the pitch of each sound, e.g., o-m-u-n-t- uˉ u ˉ ; or the stress; that is, the place in a word or in a segment where muscular energy is placed; e.g. o'muntu, most energy here is placed on the syllable -muwhen pronouncing the word. We will also neither deal with the syllable structure (minimal combinations of consonants and vowels) nor vowel harmony (influence of sounds on each other). Most of these aspects are usually called 'supra-segmental' features. For Bantu languages, one of the most important supra-segmental features is the 'tone'; that is, a pitch in a word that can bring about a change in meaning (Taylor, 1959). For example, in Runyankore-Rukiga: This important feature has not been dealt with in this study; however, we shall say a few words about tone.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Tone in Runyakitara", "completion": "From the research conducted, tone, which Fromkin and his colleagues (2003) describe as the vocal sound with reference to its pitch, quality, and strength, is clearly attested in Runyankore-Rukiga. It is used in providing meaning of words whose spelling is the same but vary in pronunciation. That variation is only explained by the existence of tones. Examples include: However, tone seems to be lacking in Rutooro and very few cases remain in Runyoro. It is rather surprising that Runyoro-Rutooro is in that situation. This is because most of the East African Bantu languages surrounding Runyoro-Rutooro and intimately related to it have tone. It would appear, however, that Runyoro-Rutooro must have been fully tonal at a given moment and that the process of tone levelling must have occurred over time. Moreover, although in Rutooro no lexical items are attested that can be distinguished by tone alone, some remnants of tonal distinction do exist at sentence level, indicating the presence of grammatical tone. Compare, for instance, the following sentences: One can also quote a children's play word or pun where ambiguity is supposed to bring about different meanings. When one studies the tone patterns carefully, however, the ambiguity is removed.", "category": "Phonology"}

This does not mean, however, that the speakers of Runyoro-Rutooro do not have lexical and grammatical tones at all. A few examples of this kind of tone seem to have been found in Runyoro, although such pronunciation is questionable: The above examples, except the first pair (omunyoro) were cited by Shigeki Kaji (2015) and he confirms that such tonal contrasts do not exist in Rutooro at lexical level. This author had already talked about the absence of lexical tone in Rutooro in an earlier publication (Kaji, 2017). Tucker (1964) is also of the opinion that there are no tones attested in RunyoroRutooro. Things are, however, different in Runyankore-Rukiga. Sentences 5 to 10 above are clear examples of grammatical tone in Runyankore-Rukiga. Although tones are fully attested both at lexical and grammatical level in Runyankore-Rukiga, it appears that there has been a process of tone levelling among the younger generations of the speakers of Runyankore-Rukiga.

We shall see, however, later, that the slightly higher number of sounds in Runyankore than in the other dialects is essentially due to the fact that in Ankore, there are two distinct social groups, the Bahima and the Bairu, with each group having some special characteristics in pronunciation. This situation does not arise among the speakers of the other three dialects. We note that sounds that are not common to all dialects are: We note here that most of the exceptions are found in Runyankore. But here, again, it is because of the two varieties of Runyankore. In fact, the sounds ts,kg ts,k g , and gg g g all belong to the Bahima. This would mean, then, that the non-Bahima are quite close to the Rukiga speakers in pronouncing their consonants. From the charts, we also note that the Rukiga speakers have the least number of exceptions in their consonants; that is, all their consonants are shared with at least one other dialect. Following is a list of examples to illustrate the utilisation of the above sounds: If one looks closely at the examples given above, one will notice that, out of the 29 sounds illustrated, it has been possible to give identical examples in Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga for 17 sounds. For a further eight sounds, the examples showed some differences. Finally, for four sounds, namely; ky, gy,3 k y , g y ,3, and ts, examples could only be found in Runyankore-Rukiga. Of these last four, only 3 appears in Runyankore-Rukiga as a whole whereas the other three are somewhat attested in Ruhima. Tentatively, therefore, one can say that fairly similar examples can be found in the utilisation of about three quarters of the sounds. We need, however, to examine these sounds in more detail to find out how and where they differ or are similar in their utilisation in the different dialects. p p and h h These two sounds, which are far removed from each other from the articulatory point of view, are otherwise quite close in Runyakitara.

It has been pointed out that Runyakitara speakers, especially from Ibanda area, also sometimes use a fricative r[r] r[r] rather than the rolled [i].

As a general rule, ' k k ' is pronounced as c c and ' g g ' as j j when they are followed by i i or y y. In the orthography, when ' k k ' or ' g g ' are followed by e e, they are usually written with ' y y ' as ' ky ky ' or ' gy gy ' to show palatalisation. Thus, kye and gye are opposed to other cases where e e following ' k k ' or ' g g ' does not bring about palatalisation. When it comes to k+i k+i or g+i g+i, however, the letter ' y y ' is omitted to show palatalisation. It is assumed that whenever i i occurs before ' k k ' or ' g g ', palatalization automatically occurs. In the case of kye and gye, there is need in the orthography to add or not to add the palatal y y. This is because in some instances where ' k k ' or ' g g ' is followed by e e, there is no palatalisation. This is usually when there is a morphological boundary between k k or g g and the next morpheme. Examples to illustrate the above include: In the examples above, ky ky and gy gy are usually not heard. In other cases, the pronunciation of palatalised k k and g g has some variations. The Rukiga speakers tend to pronounce them as full palatals; that is, omukyeeka (mat), is pronounced [omuceeka] and omugyenyi (visitor), is pronounced [omujeni]. Many Runyankore speakers, especially among the agricultural Banyankore or the non Bahima, also tend to pronounce in the same manner. The Bahima, on the other hand, have a tendency to pronounce a palatalised velar, which, phonetically should be transcribed as [kv] [k v ] and [gv] [g v ], that is, k k and g g, with a slight y y.

This was not done in detail but enough examples were given to show that the sounds that were considered as phonemes were contrastive. We then proposed two phonological sub-systems and an overall system based on the totality of phonemes identified. It is hoped that a further study of these sounds will lay more emphasis on their acoustic nature, on the supra-segmental features, and on the phonological processes such as assimilation, deletion, fortition, lenition and insertion that may exist in this language.", "category": "Grammar"}

It was first used for linguistic purposes in 1859 by the German linguist August Schleicher (Salmon, 2000) to refer to the study of the form of words. In present-day linguistics, the term 'morphology' refers to the study of the internal structure of words and of the systematic form-meaning correspondences between words (Booij, 2012). Morphology is an essential subfield of linguistics. According to Hamawand (2011), morphology generally aims to describe the structures of words and patterns of word formation in a language. Specifically, it aims to: (i) pin down the principles for relating the form and meaning of morphological expressions, (ii) explain how the morphological units are integrated and the resulting formations interpreted, and (iii) show how morphological units are organized in the lexicon in terms of similarity and contrast. The study of morphology uncovers the lexical resources of language, helps speakers to acquire the skills of using them creatively and, consequently, express their thoughts and emotions with fluency.", "category": "Morphology"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Morphological Typology", "completion": "Languages of the world have been classified using various criteria, one of which is morphology; that is, based on their language structure. Linguistics has traditionally classified world languages based on their structure into four broad categories according to Spencer (1991): isolating, agglutinating, inflectional/fusion and polysynthetic languages. Isolating/analytic languages are languages with limited morphological processes except for compounding. Here, separate grammatical concepts tend to be conveyed by separate words and not by morphological processes. In other words, it is a language in which almost every word consists of a single morpheme. Languages such as Chinese, Vietnamese are regarded as isolating languages. Agglutinating languages are languages with many morpheme-based words and each morpheme corresponds to a single lexical meaning or grammatical function. It has been noted that most Bantu languages, including Runyakitara group, are agglutinative. Inflectional/fusion languages refer to languages where words change form because of all sorts of grammatical categories such as tense, mood, agreement, etc. Polysynthetic languages - language in which words tend to consist of several morphemes. Polysynthetic languages have a high morpheme to word ratio. Classifying languages in this manner has been criticized as inconsistent and useless. The inconsistency is such that no language has been found to exist in one category exclusively. For example, English can have isolating, inflectional and agglutinating features. Secondly, the classification is considered useless because there is nothing interesting that comes out as a result of classifying languages this way. This classification, however, is still referred to and forms a basis for understanding languages' structural behaviour. In addition, there is no better typology that has been suggested that challenges the existing one.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Morphological Typology and Runyakitara Morphology", "completion": "Runyakitara has isolating features where a word expresses meaning without being split further, for example, words such as eego (yes) ngaaha (no) and busha (nothing) in Runyankore-Rukiga exhibit features of isolating morphology. Agglutination is the main morphological type of Runyakitara. Words consist of many morphemes, each adding meaning or grammatical function to a word; for example, the Runyankore-Rukiga form tukundane agglutinates as follows:  2pp-love-vf-rec-subjunctive (Let us love one another) tu,a,n tu,a,n and e e have been added to the verb root kund, each adding a meaning or grammatical function to the main verb root. Runyakitara also has features of fusion or can also find itself in inflectional categories. Take an example of the noun, omuntu (person). Mu serves two functions: it is a class marker for the People Class and it marks number, which is singular. Therefore, omuntu inflects for both class and number. What is a morpheme? According to Bloomfield, the father of structural linguistics (Bloomfield, 1933, pp. 161-168), a morpheme can be decribed as a minimal meaningful element of a word. The word, muhe (give him/her) in Runyankore-Rukiga, has three morphemes: mu mu, the subject pronoun \"him/her\", and h h, the verb root of \"give\", and e e is a verb end marking subjunctive. The three units making up the word form mu−h−e mu−h−e are explained in detail: a) each unit is meaningful; b) the units cannot further be sub-divided, thus indicating that they are the smallest; c) each of these units contributes meaning or grammatical function to a word. One of the facts about morphemes is that they have a physical (phonological and phonetic) form and also a meaning or function within the grammatical system (Spencer, 1991). A physical form of a morpheme is a morph or a word segment that represents a morpheme in sound and writing. Writing, for example, the word okusindika (to push), is represented by four morphs: o-ku-sindik-a, each representing a morpheme. A common example is the English past tense spelled as '-ed'. It has various morphs: It is realised as [t] after the voiceless [p] of 'jump' (cf. 'jumped'), as [d] after the voiced [l] of 'repel' (cf. 'repelled'), and as [əd] after the voiceless [t] of 'root' or the voiced [d] of 'wed' (cf. 'rooted' and 'wedded'). The various morphs mentioned here represent one morpheme called past tense. The different realisations or alternative forms of a single morpheme are called allomorphs. Allomorphs in Runyakitara are well elaborated by a causative morpheme that is realised as es in ku-reeb-es-a, or make to see; is in ku-kwat-is-a, to (make to catch/touch); y y in ku-ham-y-a, to (make firm). The appearance of one morph over another, in this case, is determined by voicing and the place of articulation of the final consonant of the verb stem.", "category": "Morphology"}

In omulimi, the final - i i is to be considered as a different morph because it serves to nominalise the action of the verb kulima. The verb ku-lim-a changes into a noun o-mu-lim-i through a derivational process. We will meet derivation in the following sections. In okulindirra: We could also examine the following sentences: i) Titumumanyire. We don't know him. ii) Akatusangaho. He found us there. These can be broken down as follows: ti-tu-mu-many-ire a-ka-tu-sang-a-ho In (i), morphemes and morphs are: In the second example, the morphemes and morphs are: As can be seen from the above, bound morphemes do not have complete meanings but some \"segment\" of meanings. The mere fact that −a −a at the end of a verb can help in distinguishing azina, \"he sings,\" from azine, \"let him sing,\" shows that −a −a is a different morph from −e −e, the former expressing an indicative (or declarative) and the latter a subjunctive or an indirect order. In a language that is familiar, and more especially in a language that is unfamiliar, one proceeds by partial comparisons of word segments. Let us examine them in Runyoro-Rutooro: In examining the above word forms one can come to some conclusions. For instance, simply by working at the translations, one can suppose that -zin- or -zina seems to have the meaning of sing or to sing! This is because this segment is recurrent in all the examples and there is always sing in the translation. On the other hand, ku Examples: ku (means the infinitive to.

In the following words in Runyankore-Rukiga, roots and affixes are illustrated: In the above examples, we can obtain the following roots: The root is therefore the basic form containing the basic meaning of a word and not reducible to any further meaning. The morphemes that come before, after, or within the root are called affixes. The affixes before the root are called prefixes while those after the root are suffixes while those within the root would be called infixes. Bantu languages (including Runyakitara) are well known for making their sentences by agglutinating different affixes before and after a root as in (Runyoro-Rutooro): 'We have never seen him/her at all'. Literally, 'We did not see him ever, even a little.' This very long sentence could be said to be a one-word sentence. If we can define words as items which are usually found in dictionaries, however, then clearly the above is not a word but an item belonging to the grammar of the language. It is therefore more of a sentence than a word.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Inflectional and Derivational Affixes in Runyakitara", "completion": "Affixes are characterised either as inflectional or derivational. a) Inflectional Affixes: They are those which refer to aspects of grammar such as person, gender, number, tense, aspect, mood and are often called grammatical categories. are all inflectional affixes expressing person ( a− a− ), tense ( −ka− −ka− ), person ( tu− tu− ) and mood ( −a −a ). In the word o-ku-gum-is-ir-iz-a, o- and -ku- are inflectional affixes expressing the infinitive. On the other hand, -is-, -ir-, -iz- are not inflectional affixes but verb extensions. −a −a could be said to be inflectional because it also participates in expressing the infinitive mood. b) Derivational Affixes: These may modify the meaning of a word but do not refer to the grammatical categories talked about above. They may or may not change the class of a word, e.g. from noun to verb or from adjective to noun, etc. When derivational affixes change the class of words, we have instances when a verb can become a noun as indicated below: Here, the suffix −i −i is a derivational affix, which changes a verb into a noun. Other examples could be: okwombeka to build From the verb okwombeka, we can derive the following nouns: The above examples demonstrate that we can derive different nouns from the verb okwombeka. The final vowel of the verb, which is the suffix −a −a, becomes −i −i when the derived noun is an agent or doer of action. The derived nouns are assigned Class 1 and 2; that is, noun classes for human. The final −a −a becomes −o −o when the derived noun is an instrument or a place, as shown by the Runyankore-Rukiga examples below: Instrument: okukondoora (to sweep): ekikondoozo (broom) (typically Rk) Place: okushima (to learn/study): e-i-shom-er-o (a school - a place where people receive education) okuriisa (to graze): e−i e−i-riis-iz-,-o (a grazing place) Derived nouns with semantic meaning of place or location are assigned Class 5 and 6 , while the instruments are typically placed in Classes 7 and 8 (see Noun Class on p.71). Nouns derived from verbs are termed deverbal nouns. A deverbal noun can take the final vowel as −a,i−,o,−e −a,i−,o,−e depending on the meaning to be encoded.

An allomorph represents a certain manifestation of a morpheme in determined conditions. For instance, some Runyakitara verbs show certain modifications in their roots in specific circumstances, for example ( Rn/Rt Rn/Rt ): When the above verbs are followed by the perfective -ire or the near past -irege, the roots change as follows: And yet, From the above examples, one can see that the root remains invariant except when followed by any other tense/aspect except -ire or -irege when -gend-becomes genz - to go -rund-becomes runz - to heap -cand-becomes canz - to suffer It can be said that -gend-, rund- and cand-become genz, runz, and canz when followed by -ire. The perfective -ire, especially in Runyoro-Rutooro, also gives a good example of morphemes and allomorphs. The most common allomorphs for the perfective are -ire and -ere. This means that -ire and -ere are different manifestations of the same morpheme (the perfect or perfective). Furthermore, these allomorphs appear in specific, well-determined conditions as in the following examples in Runyoro-Rutooro: See also the following examples: Generally speaking, the above examples bring out the following rules: In bisyllabic verb stems (1), -ere is found when the vowel preceding the last consonant is either o o or e e, as in the following: The verb stems here are: (See previous examples in (i)) In bisyllabic verb stems, -ire is found in all other conditions, i.e. when the vowel preceding the last consonant of the stem is i,a i,a, or u u e.g. (See previous examples in (ii)). In verb stems of more than two syllables, the tendency is always to have -ire as the perfective in the examples in (ii) above. 1 1 Other examples are: The following points should be noted: The allomorphs for the perfective are not only -ire and -ere, although these are the most common. Others are -ize, -eze and -ine, as will be shown in the study on the verb. The rule for -ire and -ere is not always respected, especially by Rutooro speakers. In such words as: -ire seems to be more acceptable in Tooro while the rule would make one expect -ere as most people in Bunyoro do. 1 It could also be noted that in Runyankore-Rukiga, -ere is hardly heard but ire seems to be the general form for not the perfective as in Runyoro-Rutooro but the near past as we shall see later. 3.

In Runyakitara, we can add that where a class has no prefix to determine the grammatical number, the concord serves a basis for determining its class. Runyakitara nouns can be broken down into three major parts, namely: initial vowel, noun class prefix, and noun root.

They may function both as subjects and objects in a sentence. They include: Examples, as subjects: Nyowe ndwaire I am sick Nibanywa naitwe They are drinking with us b) Dependent Personal Pronouns: These pronouns cannot stand independently as those in a) above.

Examples (Ry/Rk) gu-gw-ire haihi n'eishomero it fell near the school gu-gu-gw-er-e-ire it fell on it tu-ka-reets-ire we brought it ti-bu-ka-sheesh-ire it is not yet dawn", "category": "Grammar"}

For instance, (Ry/Rk): a) Maama ampaire ekikopo eki my mother gave me this cup b) Ninkunda eki I like this eki in (a) above is a demonstrative adjective, while in (b) is a demonstrative pronoun. Demonstrative pronouns in Runyankore-Rukiga are indicated in the table below: The sentences below could illustrate the table above: i) Ziriya zaanywa, kwonka ezi tizaanywa. (Those have drunk, but these have not.) ii) Ago nigoosya, kwonka aga gahozire. (That is hot, but this one is cold.) iii) Ebi bite aho haza biri obireete. (Put these there, and bring those here.) It should be noted that where a class is followed by (pl) or \"plural', e.g. 2 (pl), the English translation should not be 'this' but 'those' or 'those here', 'those there' and 'those 'far' as the case may be. Ori and oriya tend to be used interchangeably among Banyankore-Bakiga with Banyankore tending to use 'ori' than 'oriya' to mean 'that far'. Class 14 (tu) can either be a plural (otukazi - tiny little women) or collective (otutaka - a tiny amount of soil). In the first case, 'these' or 'those' will be used while in the second case 'this' or 'that' will be used. What has been said in the previous paragraph also applies to the Runyoro-Rutooro examples below. In Runyoro-Rutooro the corresponding demonstrative pronouns would be the following: We should note that in Runyoro-Rutooro 'that one there' and 'that one at a distance' are rendered by the same morpheme; i.e., --li(ri), whereas in RunyankoreRukiga the suffix -ya is added to -ri meaning 'that' far. In Runyoro-Rutooro, in order to differentiate between 'that one there' and 'that one at a distance' or 'far' one tends to use a rising intonation in the second instance, i.e. for 'that far'. If we used tone markers, we can illustrate this differentiation by the following example: óli- 'that there' as opposed to óli- 'that far'. (2) Interrogative Pronouns: Interrogative pronouns are used in inquiry to ask direct questions. They are made up of class prefix, followed by the following markers: -ha, hi hi and −ki −ki as in the following examples: oha? 'who', ki? \"what\" hi? \"who\" (Ry/Rk). The following sentences (Ry/Rk) will illustrate the above: N'oha? (Who is it?) Ni baahi? (Who are those?) Niki? (What is it?) Nikiha? (Which one?) (3) Possessive Pronouns: These are pronouns that show ownership or possession. The possessive pronoun consists of markers indicating: i) the possessed, ii) the possessive marker, iii) the possessor. For example, ekyange [e-ki-a-nge] (mine) in Runyoro-Rutooro can be broken down as follows:", "category": "Nouns"}

In Runyakitara, counting is done as follows: In Runyakitara, the following examples show the use of cardinal pronouns: Mushanju bakaba baine abaana, ikumi bataine. Seven had children, ten did not. (Ry/Rk) Ababiri bamira ebigambo, abasatu babisatura. The two swallow words, the three scatter them. (Rn/Rt) Bataano bahikire, ikumi tibakahikire. Five have reached, ten have not yet reached. (Rn/Rt) (5) Indefinite Pronouns: Indefinite pronouns are those referring to one or more unspecified objects, beings, or places. They are called \"indefinite\" simply because they do not indicate the exact object, being, or place to which they refer. Boona, bakye, baingi, bingi, kikye, kakye, gamwe, are some examples in Runyankore-Rukiga. Indefinite pronouns in Runyakitara can be used as follows: Boona baija hati All of them have come now. Bamwe baine, abandi tibaine Some have, others do not have Baija baine bukye kwonka batwara bwingi They have come with few, but they have taken much (6) Relative Pronouns: These normally replace a noun in a relative clause, where they play the role of subject or object. They are normally represented by a class prefix with its initial vowel with some minor modifications. This can be demonstrated in the following Runyankore-Rukiga sentences: Abaana abu naareeba n'abaawe. The children whom I have seen are yours. Abaana abarikwija n'abaawe. The children who are coming are yours. In the first sentence, abu abu is a relative pronoun playing the role of object, while in the second sentence, abu abu is the same pronoun but playing the role of subject. In Runyakitara, the relative pronouns derived from the different noun classes are indicated below: A few examples with Class 7 are given below in Runyoro-Rutooro: Ekisono eki tuhiigire tukiriire. The animal that we have hunted, we have eaten (We have eaten the animal that we have hunted). Ekihuka ekimurumire tukiisire. The insect that has bitten him, we have killed. (We have killed the insect that has bitten him.) As a general rule, in Runyakitara orthography, when the relative pronoun plays the role of subject, it is attached to the clause that it heads, whereas when it plays the role of object, it is separated from it.", "category": "Nouns"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: The Morphology of the Adjective", "completion": "An adjective is a word which qualifies a noun by describing its size, colour, shape etc. Although there is no universally adopted definition of an adjective, it is agreed that they are modifiers, qualifiers, and describers of nouns. Adjectives explain more about words (nouns and pronouns) by answering questions such as what kind, which one, and how many. In Bantu languages, adjectives have been labelled as 'true' adjectives, and adjectives which function in the place of other word categories especially pronouns. In this book, we have instead borrowed from Segerer (2008) the term primary adjectives as the appropriate term in relation to what we are referring to. A classical feature of the primary adjectives in Bantu languages is that they follow a noun they qualify (Segerer, 2008). A typical primary adjective in Runyakitara consists of three morphological elements. The first morpheme is the optional Initial Vowel, which, when available, has some syntactic function(s) to the noun/whole sentence. Next, is the nominal agreement prefix which is the same as the nominal class prefix of the noun. The third element is the adjective root, which contains the basic meaning of the adjective. This is exemplified as follows: From the above example, the adjective o-mu-rungi, which qualifies omwana has three segments as: o- initial vowel (IV) mu- class marker rungi-adjective root 'good' Some of the primary adjective roots in Runyakitara include: Note that these adjectives can be used to describe nouns from any noun class where applicable. The adjective concords for the above adjectives are the same as the noun class prefixes for instance: omushaija (man) muhango (big) abashaija bahango, (big men) omuserukare omudoma (the stupid soldier) An adjective can qualify (describe) two nouns belonging to the same noun class by using the plural prefix for that noun class. Examples are: Omuhyo gunu na guli mi-kooto (Rn/Rt) This knife and that one are big. Ekitabo eki na kiri ni bi-hango (Ry/Rk) This book and that one are big. However, if the nouns belong to different noun classes, then the bi-is used. For example: Enjoka n'ekikyere birwaine The snake and the frog fought. (N-class) (KI-class) (BI- prefix) Primary adjectives in Runyakitara can also stand independently and serve as nouns as follows:", "category": "Adjectives"}

For example: abaana ba-ombi both children (children both) It is important to note that numerals can also be used independently, that is, on their own, and in this case, they serve as nouns as illustrated in the following example: Itaano yangye yaaza hi?

It went on to examine the noun and those other parts of speech that are usually associated with the noun, namely, the pronoun and the adjective. Runyakitara has an elaborate noun classification system worth noting, but a simple noun structure. A simple nominal morphology centres on the fact that the majority of the nouns in Runyakitara constitute only three morphemes: the pre-prefix, the prefix, and the root. A noun suffix occurs as a nominaliser from derivation processes. A pronoun, which stands in the place of a noun, too, has a simple structure but a detailed categorisation sysyem. A simple structure in a sense that it occurs as a single morpheme, either free or bound. Detailed categorisation relates to the fact that pronouns are either personal or impersonal. Personal pronouns are classified as independent and dependent. Each noun class in Runyakitara has its own dependent pronoun either functioning as a subject or object when in combination with verbs. The next chapter will essentially deal with the verb and those other parts of speech closely related to the verb.", "category": "Grammar"}

In this particular study, the concept of tense and aspect as they relate to Runyakitara (Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga) will have the following meaning: Tense: the action of the verb seen at a given moment in time. Aspect: the internal nature of an action, i.e. the action seen at its beginning, at its end, as on-going, as completed, etc. In other words, the way the action is perceived. Guillaume (1970) defines aspect as the time of a process seen from its internal developments. Aspect as a concept could also refer to the inherent nature of an action within the verb as a lexeme. For instance, the action in the Runyakitara verb kuzina (to dance) is perceived by its own nature as having a certain duration. On the other hand, in the Runyakitara verb kunaga (to drop) one does not see this inherent duration in the action. Furthermore, in both tense and aspect, adverbs or adverbial phrases can be used to express different tenses (moments in time) or aspects (the way the action is perceived). For instance, in the Runyakitara sentence akaija ijo (he came yesterday or the day before yesterday) the moment in time is not only expressed by the tense marker ka ka but also by the adverb ijo (yesterday or the day before yesterday). In the same way, in the sentence nitubaza mpora (we are talking slowly) the way the action is perceived can be seen in the tense/aspect marker ni, the verb lexeme baza (talk), since talking always takes time, as well as the adverb mpora (slowly). In the present study, it is important to point out that tense and aspect will be analysed as they are expressed through their markers or morphemes, for example: ni - present, progressive, ka Examples: ka (far past, et cetera.).", "category": "Grammar"}

However, as opposed to the simple form, the complex form is characterized by several tense/aspect markers which combine to bring out one meaning. The final product is sometimes difficult to characterize as a tense or an aspect as it most often also incorporates mode and sometimes negation. The following complex markers can be enumerated. As said earlier, the above forms portray different notions which include mode (-aa-ku...ire, -kaa----ire), aspect (ti---ki---ire, ni---ki---a---), (-a---aa----ire, - a−−−−ga a−−−−ga ) and tense ( −a−−aa−ga− −a−−aa−ga − ​ ). These forms, taken as morphemes, are what one could partly call discontinuous morphemes. Taken in isolation, the different forms could mean something else but brought together, they convey a different meaning. For instance, in -aa-ku---ire, -aa---- alone could express the immediate perfective, −ku −ku - the infinite ire the [perfective] ( Rn/Rt) Rn/Rt). But when they are brought together, they express the conditional (or hypothetical mode) in Runyoro-Rutooro. Let us have some examples to illustrate how the above complex forms work in real sentences: (i) -aa-ku------ire mwakugenzire (mu-a-ku-genz-ire) you should go (now) bakubatiire (ba-a-ku-ba-ti-ire) (Rn/Rt) they should beat you (now) (ii) ti--ka----ire tibakaizire (ti-ba-ka-iz-ire) they have not yet come (iii) --kaa------- ire tukaamusiimire [tu-kaa-mu-siim-ire] (Ry/Rk) we should thank him (now) (iv) ni--ki-(a)----- nibakyalinda [ni-ba-ki-a-lind-a] (Rn/Rt) they are still waiting nitukishoma [ni-tu-ki-shom-a] (Ry/Rk) we are still at School (v) ti--ka----ga timukazinaga [ti-mu-ka-zin-a-ga] you have never danced (vi) -a-----ga baaraaraga mu mazina [ba-a-raar-a-ga] they used to spend the night dancing (vii) -aa-----ire naakozire [n-aa-koz-ire] I have worked enough -a-----ire Obu namurozire yairuka When I saw him, he ran away (R/Rt) Ku naamureebire yairuka When I saw him, he ran away (R/Rk) We note that the Runyankore-Rukiga form -aa----ire could have the following meanings: (1) Enough - n-aa-ri-ire pron. vp subj. eat 'I have eaten enough' (2) Recent and far past in subordinate clauses (example given in vii - When I saw him, he ran away). (3) The present perfect Very often, where the Runyoro-Rutooro speakers use -ire, RunyankoreRukiga speakers use -aa--ire as in Runyoro-Rutooro, for example: tu−li tu−li-ire 'we have eaten' Runyankore-Rukiga (i) tu-aa-ri-ire 'we have eaten' or. (ii) tu-aa-ri-a 'we have eaten' Further study should be undertaken whether Runyankore-Rukiga speakers use -aa-ire in (i) and -aa- in (ii) interchangeably or whether there are some nuances of meaning.

Ebisoro bikabura The animals got lost. Amasomero gakatandika ira (Ru/Rt) (Ru/Rt) The schools opened a long time ago. Omwana waitu akazaahira mu mahanga. Our child got lost abroad.

The doctor started talking; he said a lot of things, he advised us and gave us direction. (Ry/Rk) The examples in Runyoro-Rutooro portray single events while those in Runyankore-Rukiga show a succession of events. As can be seen, the event that follows another is usually expressed by using the form −a −a - rather than −ka −ka - or −aa− −aa− ire in the case of subordinate clauses. This rule applies both in Runyoro-Rutooro and in Runyankole/Rukiga; that is, a single past event is expressed by −ka −ka - while events following each other are expressed by −a−∼aa −a−∼aa. Note, however, that the first event is usually expressed by −ka −ka - and the subsequent ones by −aa−∼a− −aa−∼a−, as shown in this example in Runyoro-Rutooro. Hakaimuka omusaija, yaswera omukazi, baazaara abaana bingi, abaana baatandika kukura, baitu aho enjara yagwa nyingi. 'There was once a man; he got married to a woman, they got children, the children started growing up; but then a great famine came'. In the above example, the first is expressed by using the form −ka −ka - while the subsequent ones are expressed by −a− −a−. On the other hand, in complex sentences, the first past event is expressed by - −aa−∼−− −aa−∼−− ire ∼−a−−− ∼−a−−− ire and the next one by −a−∼−aa− −a−∼−aa− or −ka− −ka−. For eample: Obu nasingire, mukansiima. (Rn/Rt) When I succeeded, you congratulated me. Obu naasingire, mwansiima. (Ry/Rk) When I succeeded you congratulated me. Ku twamuteire, yaarira. (Rn/Rt) When we beat him, he wept. Ku twamuteire, akarira. (Ry/Rk) When we beat him, he wept. b) The \"imperative\" -e.

A simple definition of syntax, as Fromkin and his co-authors (2003) explain, could be summed up as the rules that govern words to form phrases and sentences. A sentence will be described in the subsequent paragraphs but we can take the phrase to be something as big or bigger than a word but normally smaller than a sentence. A phrase is usually centred on a key word category, like a noun, a verb, an adverb or an adjective. Thus, we have noun phrases whose key words are a noun, verb phrases whose key word is a verb or adjectival phrases whose key word is an adjective. In English, for instance the good boy is a noun phrase, very dirty is and adjectival phrase, plays rugby is a verb phrase and to the forest is a prepositional phrase. In that regard, Brown and Miller (2002) citing Lyons, talk of the sentence as having a certain sort of unity, being grammatically complete, capable of standing on its own, independent of context and having a degree of semantic independence.", "category": "Syntax"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Sentence in General", "completion": "It is not easy to find a satisfactory definition for the term 'Sentence'. Lyons (1968) defines sentence as \"A grammatical unit between the constituent parts of which distributional limitations and dependencies can be established, but which can be put into no distribution class\". On the other hand, traditional grammar emphasises the semantic aspect of the sentence. The sentence is supposed to be a group of words or a chain of words with a complete meaning. In written language it is said that, apart from complete meaning, a sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a full stop. This type of definition has met with a lot of opposition from different linguists and grammarians. For instance, it is not clear where a 'complete meaning' starts and where it ends. If in English for instance, a sentence like: 'The father loves his children' is said to have a complete meaning, one may ask whether a sequence like: 'The father loves his children; he is right', or 'And the father who loves his children', or even, 'The father's love for his children', have complete meaning or not. In different contexts, all the above could be said to be sentences. In some cases, a sentence can be made of only one word, such as: 'Fantastic!' Or of a semi-paragraph, like in: 'The father who loves his children for the sake of parental duty and the one who loves them from the sentimental point of view are all parents with something for and against their approach in either case; in effect, each one has something that could be of great importance to the child both from the psychological and from the social point of view, the age of the child notwithstanding.' Because of this kind of disparity in what may be regarded as a sentence, some linguists have preferred describing a sentence in terms of its different attributes which include: Possession of a certain coherence between the words that constitute it. Possession of a certain internal autonomy, such that it can in most cases stand on its own. Possession of certain types of intonation patterns, either rising and falling, or falling, or falling and rising, or rising, etc. Possession of a certain type of pause both at its beginning and at its end. Possession of a certain internal structure. Possession of a certain meaning. It is the sum total of all the above which would normally determine what a sentence is. Some grammarians have summarised the above by saying that a sentence should be characterised by a certain structure and should be able to mean something at least for the native speaker. A correct internal structure should make the sentence grammatical and acceptable meaning should make it semantic. A sentence has got different degrees of grammaticality just as it has varying degrees of being semantic. This depends on the degree of language competence on the part of the speaker and on the social milieu where the language is spoken. For instance, a sentence like 'I ain't got nothing' could be said to be grammatical in some social environments but not in others. In the same manner, a sequence like, 'I beheld the weeping trees that hid behind the friendly rocks', could be quite semantic for some enlightened poet. It is the level of grammaticality and that of semanticism which together determine whether a sentence is acceptable in a language or not, that is: a sentence must have both an acceptable structure and an acceptable meaning.", "category": "Syntax"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Sentence in Runyakitara", "completion": "If determining what a sentence is, at least in European languages, may not be very easy, it seems to be even harder for Bantu languages such as Runyakitara. Bantu languages are normally classified as agglutinative languages or at least that they tend towards agglutination. This means that these languages have a tendency in sentence formation of having a central element, usually a root, to which several affixes (prefixes, infixes and suffixes) are attached as bound morphemes. The result is often a full sentence made up of what appears in normal circumstances to be one word. This process is mostly attested in cases of pronominalisation. Compare, for instance, the following two sentences in Runyoro-Rutooro: a−ba−anaba−ngeba−li−ire a−ba−anaba−ngeba−li−ire iv cl RT cl pr cl RT pf the children may have eaten. e-bi-tooke o-mu sahaani za-itu iv pr RT iv iv cl RT cl pr the banana in the plates our My children have eaten the bananas in our plates. This fairly long sentence can be pronominalized as follows: ba-bi - ri - ri - ire - mu They have eaten them there. cl cl RT Ext pf loc subj. obj. they them eat in One can note that although the process of pronominalisation has also occurred in the English translation, the latter has five words while the former has one (that is, babiriiriremu). Apart from the above special characteristic in determining the Runyakitara (or Bantu) sentences, the above points risen for the sentence in general can also be applied to the Runyakitara sentence. For instance, a sentence in Runyakitara can also be made up of a simple word - morpheme such as: Ego (yes), just as it can be made up of a full paragraph.", "category": "Syntax"}

For example: Omwana akazaana omupiira. The child played football. child played football The child played football. Note that in the above sentence the two indispensable elements are, Omwana akazaana (The child played). Although the noun omupiira is also important if we want to have all the basic information, its deletion is not as essential as if we deleted any of the other two words. Compare: [1] Omwana akazaana. [1] The child played. [2] Omwana omupiira. [2] The child football. [3] Akazaana omupiira. [3] He played football. The first sequence in [1] is quite acceptable although we are not told what the child played. The second sequence in [2] looks unacceptable. The third sequence is quite acceptable especially as the noun \"Omwana\" (child) reappears in the verb as pronoun as is usually the case in Bantu languages. Otherwise, if this pronominalisation did not take place, the sequence no. [3] would also be very wanting because of the lack of the noun subject. As things stand in Runyakitara, sequences [1] and [3] are quite acceptable while [2] is not. Generally speaking, the basic complete sentence would have the following components in Runyakitara: a subject and a predicate, or what could also be called a noun phrase and a verb phrase, as in the following sentence: omukazi akateera omwana. woman beat child The woman beat the child. In this sentence there are two basic components: Omukazi (Woman) the subject of a sentence and; akateera omwana (she beat the child); which may be called the predicate or the verb phrase. The verb phrase here is made up of two major elements, the verb and an object which is a noun (omwana - child). On a tree diagram such a sentence could be summarily represented as follows: In transformational grammar, such a sentence is arrived at after applying different transformational rules. As was said earlier, the above sentence can undergo some pronominalisation processes such that the whole sentence appears in one word usually called a verbal in Bantu linguistics: Examples: a (ka-mu-teer-a S/he beat him. she past obj. beat vf She beat him.

[2] Omwana akabyama. [3] Omwana akateera embuzi. [4] Omwana akajima abakazi. [5] Omwana akaruga omu musiri. The child came. The child slept. The child beat the goat. The child insulted the women. The child came from the garden. [6] Omwana akazaanira omu musiri. [7] Omwana yali murungi. [8] Omwana yali mudoma. [9] Omwana yali mu musiri. [10] Omwana yali ha nju. [11] Omwana akata omwigo mu nju. [12] Omwana akarabya ente mu muhanda. [13] Omwana akaha omwojo oburo. [14] Omwana akagurra nyina orugoye. The child played in the garden. The child was good. The child was stupid. The child was in the garden. The child was at the house. The child put the walking stick in the house. The child made the cows go through the path. The child gave millet to the boy. The child bought a cloth for his mother. What is being shown in all the above sentences is that each one of them contains just the basic components. Each one of them cannot be reduced any further without affecting the grammaticality or the basic meaning of the sentence. For instance, in [1] and [2] nothing can be removed. The verbs kwija (to come) and kubyama (to sleep) are usually called intransitive verbs and do not therefore need an object. They are, so to say, self-sufficient. In [3] and [4] the verbs kuteera (to beat) and kujuma (to insult) are transitive and need therefore to be accompanied by an object. If one said: Omwana akateera or omwana akajima (The child beat or he child insulted) one feels that there is something missing. On the other hand, in sentence [5] and [6] no component can be deleted either. The verbs kuruga (to come from) and kuzaanira (to play in) need an object, often known as an indirect object, because such an object is introduced by a preposition. Such verbs are called indirect transitive verbs. This is because a verb like kuruga (to come from) requires an object preceded by a preposition indicating place, in this case (o)mu., likewise, the verb kuzaanira (to play in) is a derived verb and the derivational affix -ir- requires that the object be preceded by a preposition indicating place, that is, (o) mu mu (in). Sentence [7] and [8] contain what is known as copula verbs, in this case the verb kuba'to be' under the li form. This type of verb is necessarily followed by another component to complete it, that can be called a complement. In [7] and [8] this component is an adjective but it can also be a prepositional phrase as in [9] and [10]. In sentences 11 and 12, the verbs in akata \"he put, he placed and akarabya (he made something go through somewhere), prepositional phrases are needed, i.e. mu nju (in the house) and mu muhanda (through the path). In sentences 13 and 14 the verbs in akaha (he gave) and akagurra (he bought for) require both a direct and an indirect object, sometimes called primary and secondary objects respectively. In summary, it can be said that, in a simplified manner the basic components which we can also call constituents in a Runyakitara sentence are as follows: [1] NP+V NP+V [2] NP+V+NP NP+V+NP [3] NP+V+Adj NP+V+Adj. [4] NP+V+PP NP+V+PP [5] NP+V+NP+PP NP+V+NP+PP [6] NP+V+NP+NP NP+V+NP+NP", "category": "Grammar"}

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Types of Sentences", "completion": "In Runyakitara the major types of sentences can be said to be the following: [a] Complete and incomplete sentences. [b] Simple and complex sentences. [a] Complete and incomplete sentences A sentence is said to be complete when it provides all the basic information needed and fulfils the basic structure. Compare the following sentences in Runyankore-Rukiga: [1] Omwishiki yaagyenda. [2] Omushaija naahiiga omu kibira. [3] Embwa ekaboigorera omu kibuga. [4] Mugyenzi wangye aryagura motoka omuri Kampala. [5] Yaateeka ebyokurya omu nyungu. The girl has left. The man is hunting in the forest. The dog barked in the town. My friend will buy a car in Kampala. She has cooked food in the pot. All the above sentences are complete sentences because they appear to provide all the basic information required. Their structure is also acceptable in Runyakitara language. Sentences [1] and [3] can be said to be basic sentences because they contain only the necessary information as described earlier. Sentences [2], [4] and [5] are complete sentences but they are not basic. For instance, in [2] it is not necessary to know that the man is hunting in the forest (omu kibira). In the same manner, in [5] the information omu nyungu (in the pot) is not essential. Thus, complete sentences may be basic or non-basic. On the other hand, the sentences below in Runyoro-Rutooro cannot be said to be complete. [1] Kwigama enjura mu rufunjo. [2] Ebya ncwera nyaatire kunu. [3] Omukama ayatucungwire. [4] Amalya mabi. [5] Enganikyo otasemerire kufeerwa. Looking for shelter in a swamp. (Literally) Things of 'Give me a piece of millet which I can eat in my corner without sauce' - i.e.: Someone who has no courage to assert himself. The Lord who saved us. Poor eating. The stories that you should not miss. All the above sequences can be considered as sentences in different contexts. For instance, No. [1] is a saying, relating to someone who looks for help where help cannot be got. No. [2] is another saying as explained above. No. [3] can be considered as a sentence in a context like: Katuramye Mukama waitu! Omukama ayaatucungwire. Let us adore our Lord! The Lord that saved us. But even in this form the sentence is not complete. In No. [5] we see a sequence which is not a complete sentence. What is a Complete Sentence? Such a sentence should have a structure as described earlier in basic components of a sentence. It is the sentence of the type: NP+VNP+V+PPNP+V+Adj. ​ NP+V NP+V+PP NP+V+Adj. ​ In any sentence, the presence of a noun subject and a verb or its equivalent is usually essential. For instance, in No. [5] above (that is, Enganikyo otasemeriire kufeerwa, The stories that you should not miss), we do have a sentence with a verb kufeerwa (to miss). It can be a sentence in a context like this one: Enganikyo zaawe zisome. Enganikyo otasemerire kufeerwa. (Read your stories! The stories that you should not miss). In the latter sentence, the verb kufeerwa belongs to a relative clause that is not independent. The verb kufeerwa is therefore not the core of a complete sentence. To have a complete sentence, one would need to have a structure like: Noosoma enganikyo zaawe ezi otasemerire kufeerwa. You are reading your stories that you should not miss. In the above sentence the verb kusoma (to read) in noosoma (you are reading) acts as the core verb of the sentence where noosoma enganikyo zaawe (you are reading your stories) is the principal clause while ezi otasemiriire kufeerwa is the subordinate clause (see section on Complex Sentences). Note that a sentence can be incomplete and yet contain more than the basic components. Compare the following in Runyankore-Rukiga: [1] Eminyeeto yaabura. The youth are lost. [2] Eminyeeto yaakora emirimo mirungi. The youth have done good work. [3] Omushaija orikora emirimo omuri Mbarara. The man who will do the jobs in Mbarara. [1] and [2] above are complete sentences that also consist only of basic components, that is, NP + V. However, sentence No. [3] is an incomplete sentence without any principle clause, and yet it contains more than the basic components. In the first place, a complex sentence would be a structure like: Omushaija orikora emirimo omuri Mbarara akunda abaana. The man who will do the jobs in Mbarara, loves children. But then, even the incomplete sentence: Omushaija orikora emirimo omuri Mbarara is not a basic sentence because it has the structure NP +V+NP+PP +V+NP+PP (omuri Mbarara) which is not an essential component of that incomplete sentence. In other words, the verb kukora (to do) in orikora emirimo does not need the PP omuri Mbarara - in Mbarara.", "category": "Syntax"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Simple and Complex Sentences", "completion": "A simple sentence is centred around a single core, usually a verb, while a complex sentence is centered around more than one core (Fromkin et al., 2003). A simple sentence is made up of one clause while a complex sentence, which Brown and Miller (2002, p. 146) explain as \"those sentences that can be analysed as consisting of a number of simple sentences\" is made of two or more clauses. Let us study the sentences below in Runyoro-Rutooro. Examples: (1) Banywani bange boojo. (2) Petero ali mu Kanisa. (3) Mwijukuru wa nyinazaara akairukira mu bibira bya Buganda. (4) Obwisiki bwa nseeri hali bwikara nibunyetereza. (5) Omwana arukuhurra tabura. (6) Omukazi narra kandi n'omwana narra. (7) Nkugambiire ogende omwa Kaija. (8) Nitusaba omuntu onu agaruke. (9) Kakuba twamurozire tiyaakugenzire. (10) Noobu araija taina eki araakora. (11) Omusuma akairuka nkooku akaba atakairukaga. My friends are boys. Peter is in the Church. The grandchild of his (her) mother-in-law fled into the forests of Buganda. The small girls on the other hill continue calling me. A child who obeys is always noticeable. The woman is crying and the child is crying. I told you to go to Kaija. We are asking for this person to come back. If we had seen him, he would not have left. Even if he comes, he won't be able to do anything (he will have nothing to do). The thief ran like he had never run before. Sentence No. (1) above is a simple sentence. The verb here is represented by ∅ ∅ although it is understood to be the copula verb (to be) under the form ni. Moreover, this ni ni is found in the Runyankore-Rukiga equivalent where the above sentence would be written as: Banywani bangye n'aboojo. My friends are boys. In Kiswahili, we have: Ndugu zangu ni wavulana. My friends are boys. However, in Luganda, the Runyoro-Rutooro structure would re-appear: Emikwano gyange balenzi. My friends are boys. Sentence No. [1] is therefore a simple sentence of the VP+V+NP VP+V+NP structure. Sentence No. [2] is also a simple sentence. Its core verb is again the copula kuba under the form li li. Its structure is of the type N+V+PP N+V+PP. Sentence No. [3] is another simple sentence. This is despite the fact that it is the longest out of the ten sentences given. However, it has one core verb. Its structure is in fact of the type NP+V+PP NP+V+PP. Under a simplified tree diagram representation, it would appear as follows: Mwijukuru wa nyinazaara akairukira mu bibira bya Buganda. The grand-son of his mother-in-law fled to the forests of Buganda. What we have in the above sentence therefore is an expanded noun phrase and an even more expanded verb phrase but the sentence remains a simple sentence. It is the same thing in sentence No.[4] where the noun phrase is expanded, consisting of a noun (obwisiki - small girls) and a noun expansion (bwa nseeri hali - on the other hill); the verb phrase is made up of two verbs - one is kwikara - to remain, to continue - which serves as an auxiliary verb, to the main verb - kwetereza (to call incessantly) i.e. bwikara nibunyetereza - (they continue calling me) - or (they all the time call out for me). Sentence [5] is the first complex sentence where two clauses with two core verbs are clearly noticeable. The first clause, known as the subordinate clause, is Omwana arukuhurra (the child who obeys) - it can be seen that this clause, as a sentence, needs to be completed. It is the other clause, tabura (literally: he is never lost / he is always noticeable) - which gives to the sentence its full meaning. The second clause is called the principal clause and tends to have more autonomy than the subordinate clause. In the above sentence 'The child who obeys' is less autonomous than 'he is always noticeable.' Sentence No. [6] is another complex sentence. It is made up of two clauses more or less of equal value. These clauses are linked by a process of compounding or conjoining. The clause Omukazi narra 'the woman is weeping', has as many chances of standing on its own as the clause omwana narra 'the child is weeping'. The joining word is kandi 'and' which normally belongs neither to the first nor to the second clause. Sentence No. [7] is also a complex sentence. The first, clause is Nkugambiire 'I have told you', the second is ogende mwa Kaija 'you go to Kaija's' or 'I have told you to go to Kaija's.' Both clauses have got core verbs, in the first one kugamba 'to tell' and in the second kugenda 'to go'. It can be said that the clause nkugambiire has less autonomy than ogende mwa kaija - but this will be discussed more in detail in the subsequent sections of this chapter. In sentence No.[8] there are two clauses: nitusaba 'we are asking' which is completed by the second clause - omuntu onu agaruke 'let this person come back' - in other words: 'We are asking for this person to come back' - If we use the literal translation: 'We are asking, let this person come back' - it can be seen that the first clause seems to have less autonomy than the second. Sentence No. [9] is also made up of two clauses: kakuba twamurozire 'if we had seen him' and tiyaakugenzire 'he could not have left' - In this sentence, kakuba twamurozire clearly has less autonomy than tiyaakugenzire. Sentence No. [10] seems to be a particularly interesting one. It is made up of three clauses. The first one is Noobu araija 'even if he comes' - The second is taina 'he doesn't have' and the third is eki araakora 'anything that he can do' - that is: Even if he comes, he won't be able to do anything. This kind of sentence would be made up of a subordinate clause - noobu araija and a principal clause - taina eki araakora - And in this principal clause, another subordinate clause is embedded - eki araakora. Sentence No. [11] is also a complex sentence made up of two clauses: Omusuma akairuka (the thief ran) - is the principal clause - While - nkooku akaba atakairukaga (as he had never run) - is the subordinate clause. The first clause Omusuma akairuka seems to have more autonomy than nkooku akaba atakairukaga.", "category": "Syntax"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Sentences and Clauses", "completion": "In traditional grammar, a sentence is made up of a clause. A sentence may be made up of a clause or more than one clause (Kroegger, 2004). Each clause is made up of the basic components of a sentence as exposed earlier. We usually say that a clause has a core verb, apart from a noun subject - at least in most cases. For instance, in: Omuti nigugwa mu kibira. The tree is falling in the forest. There is Omuti (the tree) - the noun phrase subject - nigugwa (it is falling) the verb phrase containing the core verb and mu kibira (in the forest) - a prepositional phrase which can also be called an adjunct to the sentence. The above sentence has one core verb and therefore is a single clause making up one simple sentence. On the other hand, a sentence like: Omuti nigugwa mbere guroleriire. The tree is falling where it is facing. There are two clauses making up one sentence. The principal clause is: Omuti nigugwa (The tree is falling). While the subordinate clause is - mbere guroleriire (where it is facing). It can therefore, be said that every sentence is made up of at least one clause. It can, however, be made of two, three, or even more clauses. Some modern linguists do not make a distinction between sentence and clause. To them, every clause is a sentence, except that some sentences are embedded into others. For instance, in a sentence in Runyoro-Rutooro like: Omwana ou orozirege nyenkya The child whom you saw this morning arugire nambere tutaaha came from where we have been. The following sentences can be identified: [1] Omwana arugire the child has come/came [2] ou orozirege nyenkya whom you saw this morning [3] nambere tutaaha from where we have been It would be said that two sentences [2] and [3] are embedded in sentence No. [1]. What is important to note, however, is that whether these sequences are called clauses or sentences, what is important to note is that they do not all have the same order of importance. They exist in a certain hierarchical order, some being more necessary than others. In normal circumstances, the principal clause or the sentences in which other sentences are embedded, has more capacity of functioning alone than the subordinate clause or the embedded sentence. For instance, in Runyankore-Rukiga: Kuri noomuteera nooreeba If you beat him you will see The subordinate - kuri noomuteera has less chances of standing on its own feet than nooreeba which would mean literally 'you are seeing' - the latter can function as a complete sentence. In the same manner, in a sentence in Runyankore-Rukiga like: Omuti ogwagwa noogwangye The tree that has just fallen is mine The principal clause - noogwangye can be isolated and can stand on its own. On the other hand, Omuti ogwagwa 'the tree that has fallen' needs something to complete it. This does not mean that every principal clause has the capacity to function autonomously. There are those for instance which are embedded in the main verb of the principal clause or which are a compulsory component of that verb. In such cases, they function as a complement of the main verb and since the main verb cannot function satisfactorily without this clause one cannot say that the principal clause where the main verb occurs is autonomous; for example: Noogira oti araagaruka? Do you think he will come? In the above sentence in Runyoro-Rutooro - noogira - is the principal sentence and cannot be complete without the subordinate sentence - oti araagaruka. The verb kugira (to think) in the principal clause is a transitive verb which needs an object. In this case it is the subordinate clause which functions as the object, in other words the subordinate clause acts as the NP of a VP.", "category": "Syntax"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Verbal and Non-Verbal Sentences", "completion": "Some linguists consider the verb to be the core or centre of a sentence, at least most of the time. It is usually a verb which is fully conjugated and the essential part of the VP of a sentence. The two sentences below illustrate the point: Omushaija naakora ebirungi. Omushaija naakunda kukora. The man is doing good things. The man likes to work. The verb kukora (to work) in the first sentence is considered as being the head of the VP of the sentence. Some linguists would say that it is the core of the sentence. However, in the second sentence kukora (to work) is a secondary part of the VP whose head is kukunda (to like) and plays here the role of the object of the verb. In the second sentence it is the verb kukunda (to like) and not kukora (to work) as in the first sentence, which would be considered as the core of the sentence. The two sentences above are called verbal sentences, the first having kukora and the second kukunda as the main verb (core verb). There are sentences, however, which do not have such core verbs. They may be called non-verbal sentences, for example: [1] Akati karungi [2] Ihali ringi [3] Ekiro kibi [4] Empisi y'owaanyu [5] Ekigambo kirungi [6] Buculeezi bwa ntaama [7] Obusingye bwa Mukama [8] Obusuma bwa Kampala [9] Petero mutabani wa Kiiza? [10] Abaana b'omusaija ogu! [1] A good stick [2] Too much jealousy [3] A bad day [4] A hyena from your village [5] A good word [6] The sheep's quietness [7] The peace of the Lord [8] Kampala theft [9] Peter the son of Kiiza? [10] The children of that man! The sentences above can be considered as incomplete sentences. Their full meaning is obtained from the context. The first six Runyoro-Rutooro sentences are proverbs. Sometimes one does not need to say the whole proverb. Uttering part of the proverb may give it more impact, or may arouse the attention of the hearer even more. Intonation plays an important role here. It is the intonation that indicates clearly that the sentence is not completed but that the full meaning is expected to be understood. Sometimes, the hearer does complete the second part of the proverb, and the sentence is complete. The six proverbs can be completed as follows: [1] Akati karungi, otema noota ha rugo rwawe. [2] Ihali ringi lihemesa ekituuro. [3] Ekiro kibi kiita embwa kitaho omuntu. [4] Empisi y'owaanyu ekulya neekukumakuma. [5] Ekigambo kirungi kikaraaza empisi ha rugo. [6] Buculeezi bwa ntaama tibugitanga kujuga. A good stick is always for your fence. Too much jealousy makes you laugh at a grave. A bad day witnesses the death of a dog and a person. A hyena from your village eats you while covering you. A good word made the hyena spend the whole night at the fence. The silence of the sheep does not prevent it from bleating. The last four sentences are drawn from different contexts. No. [7] (RunyankoreRukiga) could be uttered at an encounter between two \"saved\" people or Pentecostals, i.e. as a form of greeting. The full sentence would be: Obusingye bwa Mukama bube naiwe! The peace of the Lord be with you! Sentence No. [8] (Runyoro-Rutooro) is an exclamatory sentence. Obusuma bwa Kampala! Theft in Kampala! Could mean: Obusuma bwa Kampala buhinguraine! There is too much theft in Kampala! Sentence No. [9] (Rn/Rt ) is a question, that needed clarification on what had been said earlier. The previous sentence could have been: Genda oramukye Petero! Go and greet Peter! The full question would have been: Ndamukye Petero mutabani wa Kiiza? Do I greet Peter the son of Kiiza? In sentence No. [10] (Rn/Rt) we have again an exclamatory type of sentence. Abaana b'omushaija ogu! Children of that man! Could mean: Abaana b'omusaija ogu bakasarra! Children of that man are terrible! Note that just as in the first six sentences, intonation plays a major role in the last four sentences. What could often have been said in words is expressed by a certain type of intonation.", "category": "Verbs"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Thematic and Predicative Sentences", "completion": "Incomplete sentences (often non-verbal) are often categorised according to whether they represent a theme or a predicate. As explained by Fromkin et al. (2003), a theme is that which we talk about. On the other hand, a predicate is what we say about the theme. In a Runyoro-Rutooro sentence like: Ekitooke kigwire. The banana has fallen. The theme is the 'banana' and the predicate is that 'it has fallen.' In a Runyoro-Rutooro sentence like: Abasigazi abarungi nitubeetaaga (The young men good we need them.) We need the good young men. The theme is: 'the good young men' The predicate is: 'we need them' Many of the non-verbal and many of the incomplete sentences either express a theme or a predicate, as in the following Runyankore-Rukiga sentences: [1] Obusingye bwa mukama. [1] The peace of the Lord. [2] Abaana b'omushaija ogwo. [2] The children of that man. [3] Okukunda bazigu baitu. [3] To love our enemies. [4] Batabani ba Mwesigwa? [4] The sons of Mwesigwa? Sentence No. [1] could be said to be thematic. We are talking about peace. The predicate is what is not overtly expressed, namely that the peace is to be bestowed upon someone. Sentence No. [2] is also thematic. We are talking about the children of a certain man. What is said about them is not overtly expressed. It could be that the children of the man are naughty, nasty or horrible or that they have broken into a shop. All that would be the predicate of the sentence. Sentence No. [3] could be said to be a predicative sentence according to the context. There could have been a previous interrogative sentence of the type. Omukama atwegyesa ki? What does the Lord teach us? And the answer to such a question would be: Okukunda abazigu baitu. To love our enemies. The theme is therefore the Lord, and the predicate that he teaches us to love our enemies. The fourth sentence could be either a predicative or a thematic sentence. If the full sentence would be like: Abaana ba Mwesigwa nibo baija? Is it Mwesigwa's children who have come? Then it is thematic. On the other hand, in a sentence like: Waateera abaana ba Mwesigwa? You have beaten Mwesigwa's children? Then it is predicative. Compounding and Embedding: Complex and Compound Sentences Complex sentences are usually made up of two types of clauses. There are clauses which are joined together in a sentence in such a way that none of them seems to be more important than the other. Furthermore, each one of them can most of the time stand on its own feet as an independent sentence. In that case we talk of conjoining or compounding. Such clauses constitute what is usually known as compound sentences. On the other hand, some sentences are made up of clauses which do not have equal importance. Some clauses seem to be more important: They seem to have more capacity to stand on their own. In that case we talk of embedded sentences or subordinate clauses for those which seem to be less important than others and principal clauses for those which appear to be more important. Let us look at the following Runyoro-Rutooro sentences: (1) Abaana barwaire kandi nyinabo azaire. The children are sick and their mother has given birth. (2) Nyowe nimbagonza baitu inywe timurikungonza. (3) Araija rundi taije? (4) Omusaija akahika ha saaha ikumi, yaturamukya, kandi yatusiima.", "category": "Syntax"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: I like you but you don't like me", "completion": "Will he come or will he not come? The man arrived at 4:00 p.m., greeted us and thanked us. (5) Bakasanga enju ekingire, baayegarukirayo. (6) Olindeka nkooku wansangire. (7) Akahunirra muno obu baamugambiire eki. (8) Noobu arairuka oraamusanga. (9) Katunihire tuti byona biraahikirra. (10) Naayesunga kandi kunu taine bazaire be. They found the house closed and went back. You will leave me as you found me. He was very surprised when he was told that. Even if he runs you will find him. Let us hope all will go well. He is naughty whereas he does not have parents. In the above examples, the first five sentences are said to be compound sentences. The clauses in each one of them are linked together by conjoining. It is usually said that the linking word belongs to none of the linked clauses. It simply helps to link one clause to another. For instance, in sentence [1] we have two clauses: Abaana barwaire The children are sick k a n d i nyinabo azaire their mother has given birth. In this sentence kandi belongs neither to the first nor to the second clause. It can also be said that each one of the two clauses can stand on its own and function independently from the other. Thus, the clause: abaana barwaire (the children are sick) does not need nyinabo azaire (their mother has given birth) to have a satisfactory meaning. Sentence No. [4] has three clauses. The first is linked to the second by a process of juxtaposition, i.e. one element joined to another without any overt mark. Thus, Omusaija akahika ha saaha ikumi - is joined to - yaturamukya - by a simple comma. In spoken language, this comma is replaced by a brief pause -. The third clause is linked to the second one by an overt mark; i.e., the conjunction kandi \"and\" - This latter case is the usual process of what we call coordination. There are therefore two processes in compounding: Juxtaposition, when no overt mark is used to link two elements of equal importance. Coordination, when an overt mark is used to link elements of equal importance. We may note that sentence No. [5] is made up of two clauses linked together by a process of juxtaposition only. Another important aspect regarding conjoining in Runyakitara is that the clauses that are conjoined do not always strictly have equal importance. For clauses which indicate a sequence of events, in the past, usually the first clause has the -ka- tense marker while the subsequent ones usually have the −a −a - marker, as in sentence [4] above. One may also note that the first clause with the −ka −ka - marker tends to have more autonomy than the subsequent clauses with the −a −a - marker. Thus in sentence [4] while the first clause; omusaija akahika ha saaha ikumi \"the man arrived at 4:00p.m 4:00p.m.\" can stand alone, it is not quite the same thing with the second clause: yaturamukya \"he greeted us\" probably because the -a- marker in the second clause indicates that another action has already taken place, and that the present action is a subsequent one. When one says: yaturamukya\" the literal translation would be 'and he greeted us.' One can say that in Runyakitara, juxtaposition, which often introduces a different marker for the past, tends also to introduce a certain degree of subordination, in the sense that the subsequent action seems to be dependent on the previous action. This usually happens when the actions are more than two. When, on the other hand the actions are only two, the -ka- past tense marker is usually used in both cases. In that case, the dependency aspect tends to disappear - for example: Akatusiima kandi naitwe tukamusiima. He thanked us and we also thanked him. Note, however, that the usage of −a −a - in the second event is still acceptable. Akatusima kandi naitwe twamusiima. He thanked us and we thanked him also. From sentence No. [6] to sentence No. [10] each one of the sentences is usually called a complex sentence made up of more than one clause. The clauses are linked together by a process of subordination or embedding, by which one clause usually has more importance and is normally capable of having more autonomy than the other clause. In sentence No. [6] for instance, the principal clause is olindeka \"you will leave me\" - Which is capable of being autonomous. The subordinate clause is: Nkooku wansangire \"as you found me.' The subordinating marker - nkooku, \"as\" is supposed to be part of the clause, and the clause clearly appears less autonomous than the principal clause. It can be represented as follows: olindeka you will leave me nkooku wansangire as you found me In sentence No. [7] the principal clause: Akahunirra muno - is capable of having more autonomy than the subordinate: Obu baamugambiire eki. \"When they told him that\" In sentence No. [8] Noobu arairuka \"Even if he runs\" appears clearly subordinated to araamusanga \"you will find him\". The same remarks apply to sentences No. [9] and No. [10]. What is important to note, however, is that principal clauses, despite their capacity to function autonomously, still need the subordinate clauses to express the full information of a given sentence. Furthermore, even in compound sentences, conjoined or coordinated clauses, (including those joined by juxtaposition) do not enjoy full autonomy from each other. They often have the capacity to function autonomously, but in the sentences where they occur, they need each other to express the full meaning of a sentence.", "category": "Grammar"}

We saw earlier the basic structure of a simple sentence. We shall here examine the func- tions or functional relations that can be assumed by the different elements or components of a simple sentence in Runyakitara. In the first place we have to distinguish between the normal sentence and what is known as the verbal in Bantu linguistics as in the following Runyoro-Rutooro examples: (1) Amata gali omu kikopo. (2) Garumu. (3) Enjangu ekataahira mu kihuru. (4) Ekataahiramu. (5) Omukazi akatwekera iba ebbaruha Kampala. (6) Akagimutwekerayo. (7) Enkende etembere ha muti. (8) Etembereho. The milk is in the cup. It is there. The cat entered into the hole. It entered there. The woman sent a letter to her husband in Kampala. She sent it to him there. The monkey has climbed on a tree. It has climbed there. The above are typical examples of simple sentences. The process of agglutination brought about by pronominalisation is very clear in sentences (2), (4), (6) and (8). One notices also the striking difference in English and in Runyakitara. Sentence (6) for instance is a one-word sentence in Runyakitara but has six words in English. The sentences above have the NP + VP; where VP consists of Aux + V + PP.

Let us examine the Runyankore-Rukiga sentences below: In: Omwana akunda abazaive be munonga. The child loves his parents a lot. Omwana is subject; akunda abazaive be munonga is the predicate. In: Omwana ari omu musiri. The child is in the garden. Omwana is the subject; ari omu musiri is the predicate. In: Omwana naatuteganisa buri kaire. The child is disturbing us all the time.

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: The Object", "completion": "The object is usually the element that comes after the verb and which is intimately linked to the verb in such a way that without it the verb lacks something essential. Compare these four sentences ( Ry/Rk Ry/Rk ): (1) Omushaija agwejegyeire. The man is asleep. (2) Omushaija naakunda abaana. The man loves children. (3) Omushaija naakunda abaana munonga. The man loves children a lot. (4) Omushaija agwejegyereire omu kitanda. The man is asleep in bed. In sentence (1), there is no object because the verb does not need one. In sentence (2), the verb kukunda (to love) needs an object hence the presence of abaana (children). In sentence (3), the verb kukunda (to love) still needs the object, abaana (children). Then something extra is added munonga (a lot). This last element is not necessary for the full expression of the verb. That is why munonga (a lot) can be deleted without radically modifying the meaning of the sentence or rendering the sentence non-grammatical. For instance, sentence (2) without munonga is quite acceptable. On the other hand, if in sentence (3) naakunda was removed to leave: Omushaija abaana munonga. One would feel that something fundamental is lacking. In sentence (4) omu kitanda (in bed), is not considered as essential either, because it is absent in sentence (1) and yet that sentence is quite correct. As we saw earlier, an object can be direct, if it comes directly after the verb or indirect, if it is separated from the verb by a preposition or its equivalent. For instance, in: Omushaija wangye naarya oburo. My man is eating millet. Oburo (millet) is direct object. But in: Omushaija wangye naaruga omu kibira. My man is coming from the forest. Kibira is indirect object because it is introduced by the preposition omu which separates it from the verb. Note the difference between a sentence like: Omushaija wangye naaruga omu kibira. My man is coming from the forest. and: Omushaija wangye agwejegyeire omu kibira. My man is asleep in the forest. In the first case, omu kibira will be considered as the object of the verb kuruga 'to come from' because of being closely linked to it. On the other hand, in the second sentence, omu kibira is not considered as an object of the verb kugwejegyera, but rather as an adverbial complement with very loose links with the verb. Some linguists make a distinction between a verb complement, i.e. an element closely linked to the verb or an object of the verb, and a sentence complement, i.e. an element which is only loosely linked to the verb and can be considered as belonging to the sentence as a whole rather than to the verb. In the two sentences above the relationship between omu kibira 'in the forest' and the verb can be shown as follows on a tree diagram. Omushaija wangye naaruga omu kibira. My man is coming from the forest. The second sentence could be illustrated as follows: In the first example, the PP is a complement of the verb or a constituent of the verb while in the second example, PP is a complement or constituent of the sentence.", "category": "Grammar"}

In the above sentence the PP (prep + kashozi) is considered a complement of the subject abashaija (the men). The term complement, however, can also be used to mean anything that comes to complete the verb, the sentence or any other part of the sentence. In this case, we can talk of a noun complement as in: Omushaija ni murungi. The man is nice. or a verb complement as: Omushaija naaza kushoma.

The verb kukunda (to like) will be considered as having the function of verb while the verb kuzaana \"to play\" will have the function of object or complement of the verb. In the same manner, in the sentence: Tukamureeba naazaana. We saw him playing.

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: The Complement Clauses", "completion": "These are the types of clauses where usually the principal clause needs the subordinate clause to be adequately completed. Without the subordinate, the principal clause often looks very incomplete as in the following examples: Ninteekereza (nti) ali hanu. I think he is here. Ndozire nti nookora kurungi. Katunihire (tuti) muraija. Ninkigumya (nti) muntu murungi. Noogira (oti) araagaruka? Naateekateeka kwija. Akatubeiha ngu tarikwija. Ninyesiga noija kukora gye omurimo gwawe. Ningira tarikugaruka. Nimpamya ngu naija kusingura. I see you are doing well. Let us hope you will come. I am convinced he is a good person. Do you think he will come back? He is planing to come. He deceived us that he was not coming. I hope you will do your work well. I think he is not coming back. I am sure he will win. In the above examples, the first five sentences are in Runyoro -Rutooro while the last five are in Runyankore-Rukiga. The first sentence is typical of the type of sentence where the principal clause ninteekereza 'I think' remains very insufficient without the subordinate clause to complete it. The subordinate ali hanu 'he is here' is necessary to complete the sentence. The subordinating conjunction nti or subordinator 'that' can often be understood. Sentence (2) is an example where the principle clause ndozire 'I have seen' could somewhat stand on its own in a specific context. In that case ndozire, could mean that 'I have witnessed all that has taken place and have seen enough'. Otherwise, in normal circumstances, the principal clause ndozire, needs a subordinate to complete it. It can be said that the subordinate clause nti nookora kurungi, 'that you are doing well' can also stand on its own if the conjunction nti is deleted as is often the case. However, the argument is that in the subordinate clause the conjunction is always an integral part of that clause whether overtly expressed or not. As such, a clause like nti nookora kurungi, cannot stand on its own. In sentence (4) ninkigumya, 'I am sure' or literally 'I affirm it' one may say that the clause may stand on its own. However, this is basically because in the clause ninkigumya 'I affirm it' the object pronoun ki introduces an element of redundance since the \"thing\" being affirmed is what is repeated in the subordinate clause. If the sentence were: 'I am sure he is a good person' then the autonomy of the principal clause would disappear. Moreover, the above sentence, where the object pronoun is not represented, is also acceptable in Runyoro-Rutooro, and in that case, ningumya... is an incomplete sentence. In sentence (6) the principal clause is naateekateeka 'he is planning' which may have autonomy in some contexts but usually needs something to complete it. The subordinate clause kwija - 'to come' - is also an infinitive clause. The latter looks incomplete in every way. Sentence (7) has a principal clause - akatubeiha, 'he lied to us' which could be considered autonomous if the verb kubeiha, 'to lie' is used in absolute terms - i.e: not needing any explanation as to what the lying was about. Otherwise, the subordinate ngu tarikwija 'that he was not coming' is necessary. Sentence (8), (9) and (10) all have principal clauses which cannot be self-sufficient. In (8) ninyesiga, 'I am sure' or 'I am confident' needs something to complete it, especially in the Runyankore - Rukiga version. It is the same with (9) ningira 'I think' and with (10) nimpamya 'I am convinced'.", "category": "Grammar"}

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: The Relatives", "completion": "Relative clauses are characterized by the fact that they are usually noun expansions and often play the role of an adjective when the latter functions as an expansion of the noun. Compare the following sentences in Runyoro-Rutooro. [1] Omwana murungi ali hanu. [1] The good child is here. [2] Omwana omurungi ali hanu. [2] The child who is good is here. In the first example we have a simple sentence with the adjective murungi acting as an expansion of the noun omwana. On the other hand, in the second sentence we have a complex sentence made up of the following clauses: Omwana .... ali hanu (The child .... is here) — is the principal clause; and 'Who is good' — is the subordinate relative clause. Note that in Runyoro-Rutooro the clause omurungi 'who is good' does not need a verb which is overtly expressed. The deep structure of this sentence (clause) could be: ou ali murungi owaali murungi As a matter of fact, the structure: owaali murungi (who is good) could be accepted in some contexts. In the three sentences below, one could even say that all of them are correct. [1] Omwana omurungi azooka kara. [2] Omwana anyakuli murungi azooka kara. [3] Omwana owaali murungi azooka kara. A good child is identified early enough. Sentences (2) and (3) seem to lay emphasis on the 'goodness' of the child as opposed to those who are not good. Otherwise the personal opinion of the writer is that (1) and 92) could be used interchangeably while (3) seems slightly more far-fetched or stylistic. Other examples include: Omushaija ori aha ni munywani wangye. Ogu mushaija ou orikureeba ni mukuru. munonga. Ebitookye eby'omuhendo mukye, noobigura aha. Enjura erukugwa omu October ni nyingi munonga. Omuti ogwamuteera ni mureingwa munonga. Emiti ei orikutema n'eya Petero. Abaana abu murikujuma nibaza kubateera. Omukama ou baitsire asigire abaana baingi munonga. Oburwaire obu murikuhurira bwaza kumara abantu. Ebitabo ebi mwashoma bikahandiikwa omushaija ogu. The man who is here is my friend. The man whom you are seeing is very old. Cheap bananas are bought here. Bananas that cost a low price are bought here. The rain that falls in October is plenty. The tree that has hit him is very tall. The trees that you are cutting belong to Peter. The children whom you are insulting will beat you. The King whom they have killed left a lot of children. The sickness which you hear about is going to finish people. The books that you have read were written by this man. The above sentences are in Runyankore-Rukiga. There is a convention in both Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga orthography, that when the relative pronoun introducing the relative clause plays the role of subject, then it is joined to the verbal that is part of the relative clause. On the other hand, when this relative pronoun plays the role of object, then it is separated from the subsequent verbal. For instance, in sentence [1] the relative ori aha 'who is here' is made up of ou ari aha but ou ou is joined to ari to make ori, because the relative pronoun is the subject of the relative clause (the man who is here). In Runyoro-Rutooro it would have been: Omusaja owaali hanu — here again the pronoun is ou and the verbal is ali. Conventionally the two are joined to make: owaali - \"who is\". In sentence [2], on the other hand, the pronoun ou 'whom' is separated from orikureeba 'you are seeing', because here ou has an object function. It is the man who is being seen, and not the one who is seeing. Thus conventionally, we do not write owoorikureeba but ou orikureeba 'whom you are seeing'. Sentence [3] is different from the other examples. The literal translation for Ebitookye eby'omuhendo mukye would be 'The bananas of low price' however, the fact of adding the initial vowel e Examples: e (on by'omuhendo mukye 'of low price' makes the phrase become a relative clause.

Second, as the science of meaning (that is, the way in which meaning is formed). Third, as the quantity of meaning that is packaged in an expression. This is the ordinary interpretation of the word semantics. Sub-fields of semantics include: Lexical semantics (lexicology: the nature of the words and expressions of a language); conceptual semantics (meanings and concepts); logical semantics (propositions); and discourse meaning.

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Scope of Treatment of Linguistic Meaning in this Chapter", "completion": "Most studies investigate linguistic meaning at the level of words, sentences, propositions, context of utterances and discourse. The main thrust of this chapter is to show that the meanings represented by these structures, and the nature of the structures themselves are a result of what pertains in the real world and how it is expressed in a given language. For instance, if a situation occurs where a human entity uses his/her hand to pick an object such as a book from a shelf, assuming the entity is a student and the action has just happened, the situation can be expressed in Runyakitara (Ry-Rk), as: omwegi yaiha ekitabo aha materekyero (The student has removed a book from the shelf). Although the mental encoding of the action 'pick' differs between English as 'get' and Runyakitara as 'remove' respectively, the situation (that is, the event that is obtaining) is the same. It is the expression that speaks about it that differs. Depending on the language, the difference may be in terms of mental encoding which impacts on the lexical decoding (e.g., 'get' versus 'remove' as in the example above), overt marking of definiteness (e.g., 'the' as in the English sentence), etc. The correspondence of what is in language and what is in the world helps to explain the interface between situations in the real world and their encoding in language. The situations in the real world are universal, e.g. 'a human entity picks a book from the shelf' can happen anywhere, but they are encoded (or expressed differently) between languages in terms of communication. Therefore, this chapter explains the link between that which is in the language (in this case Runyakitara) and that which is in the world. It will be called linguistic isomorphism of language and phenomena.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Prior Work on Linguistic Isomorphism of Language and Phenomena in Runyakitara", "completion": "The work in this chapter is not necessarily the first one to talk about language and meaning, particularly on linguistic isomorphism. Prior work on Runyakitara exists which indirectly displays the fact of this aspect. Taylor (1985) identifies several subcategories of Runyankore-Rukiga lexicon, whereby it is representative of the phenomena (entities) in the Runyankore-Rukiga institutional and material environment. Muranga (1990) discusses the meaning and philosophy of Rukiga personal names, reflecting what is in the real world (that is, places). Both Rubongoya (2013) and Mubangizi (1963) tackle examples of parts of speech in Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga respectively in a bid to show how Runyakitara words function. The former would also show the semantic properties of words, nouns in particular as the basis of how they are grouped in noun classes. These efforts show how the works aim at portraying the way in which the mind of a Runyakitara speaker perceives the concept that is denoted by a word, and therefore how the word refers to the entity that exists in the real word as a 'concrete' object in the realm of that language. Below are examples of part of the content of the works above. Taylor (1985): Structured semantic fields (Taylor, 1985) (a) Kinship terminology: ishenkuruza (his/her great-grandfather), nyinenkuruza (his/her great-grandmother), ishenkuru (his/her grandfather), nyinenkuru (his/her grandmother), ishe (his/her father), nyina (his/her mother), mukaishe (his/her step-mother), ishento (his/her uncle), nyinento (his/her aunt), ishenkazi (his/her father's sister), (sic.) nyinashengye [Rukiga] (his/her father's sister). (b) Colour terms: Taylor (1985) deals mainly with the aspect of the naming system of the colour terms in Runyankore, the morphological formation of words for colour, examples of the colour terms and basic colour terms. It is noted that there are prefixes which denote femininity and masculinity in the colour naming system, and that the prefixes have correspondence with those for personal names. Thus, ka ka is prefix for colour terms referring to heifers (cattle), while ru ru - is a prefix for colour terms referring to bulls. A mention of names such as kagaaju (brown female cow) and rugaaju (brown male cow) would therefore justify this observation. Personal names in Runyankore-Rukiga are not necessarily referring to colour but to sex. Such names are common in the traditional society of Banyankore and Bakiga, for example Kambugiro and Rutashaazya, where the former is a name for a woman and the latter for a man. The stems for basic colour terms in Runyankore-Rukiga are given in Taylor (1985) as -era (white), -tukura (red), -iragura (black). The terms are normally adjectival in structure, whereby the prefixes that are attached to them derive from the appropriate noun class marker. Taking an example of the noun class for the word ente (cow), ekirabyo (flower) which fall in noun class 9/10 9/10 (en-/en-) and 7/8 7/8 (eki-/ebi-) respectively, the following would be the description of 'a white cow', 'a black cow' and 'a red flower': ente erikwera (a white cow), ente erikwiragura (a black cow), ekirabyo ekirikutukura (a red flower), omuntu orikwiragura (a darkskinned person). (c) Body parts: The following words among others are listed in Taylor (1985) as part of the inventory of words referring to body parts: rujuga (Adam's apple), okwahwa (armpit), omugongo (back), bladder (oruhago), omwitsyo (breath), finger (orukumu), ekigyere (foot), empiita (sweat). They represent objects/entities in the real world. However, omwitsyo (breath) and empiita (sweat) refer to entities that do not make up the framework of the body. For this reason, they would not be among the terms for body parts. Their appropriate category needs to be identified. Body respiration and body waste materials would be the immediate groupings to think about. (d) Cattle markings, botanical and personal names: Behind the names of cattle given in Taylor (1985) is the argument that the naming is based on the unique features of a cow (also emphasised in Ingfield, 2003), most of which are the markings on the skin. This is verifiable from the following names and descriptions as outlined in the work: kyasha [a cow with a] small patch on forehead mamba [a cow with a] grey and white patch(es) mbarago [a cow with a] clear brown patches mbombo [a cow with] stripped patches gaaju [a cow which is] light brown mayenje [a cow which has] black or white spots all over the body (e) Basic vocabulary: The basic Runyankore-Rukiga vocabulary listed in Taylor (1985) ranges from adjectives to verbs and nouns. It is a list which consists of about two hundred words. Examples of the words include -ona/-ena (all). This is a pronoun stem to which a noun prefix is attached. Others are: kandi; na (and), enyamaishwa (animal), aha (at), omugongo (back), enyima (behind) and -tiina (fear), sic. okutiina, v. (fear). The infinitive form as in the foregoing example is the natural form for citation of verbs. In attempting to give the basic vocabulary of a language, one is aiming at showing the main stream vocabulary of that language. Examples: Rubongoya (1999).", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Semantic Fields", "completion": "This sub-section focuses on ways of categorisation of words. The different ways are presented, compared and evaluated. Then, it is shown how they represent semantic isomorphism of language in terms of their frameworks. Together, they are viewed under a broader theory of semantic fields. A semantic field is a set of words (or lexemes) related in meaning. For example, a set of the words referring to different colours is a semantic field. This field is referred to as 'words for colour', or as 'colour terms'. Therefore, a semantic field for colour terms would include words such as red, green, black, purple, white, orange, blue, among others. Figure 5.2 below shows a semantic field of colour terms. Figure 5.2. A semantic field of colour terms The words in a semantic field share a common semantic property, i.e. subject matter. For instance, the semantic field for colour terms consists of all words referring to colour. Museveni et al. (2012) make an assumption that words exist as names of things belonging to different domains (that is, semantic fields). The main domains identified in this work which in some respects tends to follow the model of grouping of words in Roget (1987) are indicated below: [1] Words for things of the heavens, earth and cosmology [2] Words for plants [3] Words for animals [4] Words to do with human kind [5] Words to do with human language [6] Words to do with social behaviour in closely related communities [7] Words for agriculture and preparation of foods and beverages [8] Words for livestock farming, milk and meat [9] Words for work and the world of skills [10] Words to do with dressing, ornaments and perfumes [11] Words for travel on land, water and in the air. Each of the broad domains of words has sub-domains. For instance, the domain for words of plants has these sub-domains with corresponding words. Examples in Museveni et al. (2012) include the following (translation and comments are mine, where the source is not indicated): Words for plants amacanda (sunflowers) amababi (leaves) amashaari (tree branches), eishaari (tree branch) eibwa (thorn) amahwa (thorns) Words for grasses, creepers and weeds ekiraare (weeds) encenzilenkyenzi (goose grass) omutanga (inedible pumpkin-like plant) omucuamba (star-grass) Words for mushrooms, mosses and weeds ebituzi (large edible mushrooms), ekituzi (large edible mushroom) entyabirilensyabiri [dialectal difference] (type of large mushrooms) engongi (algae) okuhumba (to catch moulds) okwiha obutuzi (to pick a smaller type of mushrooms) omugina (area where the mushrooms have grown) By using word domains, Museveni et al. (2012) would like to base on the theory of semantic fields to put Runyankore-Rukiga words into (natural) lexical groups based on the natural order of things. The work somewhat deviates from the treatment in Roget's Thesaurus where words are grouped following a philosophical dimension to show semantic fields. Landau (1989) portrays that Roget (1779-1869) divided up vocabulary into six main areas, namely, abstract relation, space, matter, intellect, volition (will) and affections. These do not reflect the philosophical but rather the natural dimension of things. Roget (1989) based on them to compile what is commonly known as Roget's Thesaurus. To get the words under each of the domains in the thesaurus, he looked at the concepts/things and named them. The names of the concepts formed the vocabulary; English vocabulary in this case. For instance, for the concept of 'affections' in Roget (1987), the following classification is found: Affection: general terms, personal, sympathetic, moral, religious Moral: obligation, sentiments, conditions, practice, institutions Practice: temperance, intemperance, sensualism, asceticism, etc. Following both the natural order of things approach and the philosophical dimension approach, it is assumed that it is possible to divide up the vocabulary of a language into semantic fields, much as the two approaches do not yield the same results. Both approaches can also create cross-cutting terms; that is, terms which belong to more than one domain. For instance, in English, love (n.) can belong to 'affection' and 'moral' sub-domains. In Runyankore-Rukiga, ekiraare (weeds) and omucwamba (star-grass) can belong to the plant domain and to the grass domain at the same time. Crystal (2003, p. 104) observes that another inconsistency on the part of semantic fields is that, [There is] ... a great deal of variation as we move from one part of the language to another. For instance, whereas it is easy to make a perfect semantic field for words to do with 'body parts' or 'names of fruits', it is not quite the same for words to do with 'noise' or 'ornaments' (things used for decoration). According to Crystal (2003), some words for \"noise\" or \"ornaments\" will not seem to be exactly belonging to the same concept. Examples are music and watch respectively. Cross-cutting terms and fitness of a term in a semantic field create a challenge of getting a consistent approach for establishing semantic fields, and therefore, the need to continue looking for more consistent (precise) divisions of concepts. The question is: under what semantic approach can words be perfectly divided? This is one end that some linguists could have come to in search for perfect divisions of words. The situation-role theory enunciated in Kiingi (2009) moves towards this perfection. In the theory, divisions of all things are enunciated, as in Table 5.3 below. Table 5.3. Division of all things The list is a range of entities that exist. All sub-entities that fall under an entity have 'names'. Examples are shown in Table 5.3 under the column for objects. The names are the words in the vocabulary of a language. For instance, the term 'flower' is under 'plant' because a leaf is a plant object. The term 'house' is under material objects. This shows that what is in the language is also in the world, and most likely vice versa. Hence, the terms 'four' and 'tomorrow' come under quantity and temporal objects respectively. These kinds of divisions qualify to be the domains of words. The above are taken as the domains into which the mind divides up all things. Apart from the domains and the terms (words) under each of them, the situa-tion-role theory specifies that the entities referred to by the terms (words) are acted on, and the actions are spoken about. For example, 'a flower withers'. This is an action which is a result of force/conditions of nature. Seen from another example, a number is counted or added to another. It is possible that when actions take place, they are spoken about. Speech is in terms of sentences. Sentences follow the logical order of the action (depending on the language). For instance, the order of the event 'a flower withers', has the intrinsic structure 'something changes', which in speech (in English expression) is SV (Subject + Verb); that is, The flower withered or The flower has withered. Kiingi (2008a), Kiingi (2008b) and Kiingi (2009) posit the following roles that are played by entities. Table 5.4: Roles played by entities To view the above as actions, we can talk of 'changes', 'causations', 'nonchanges', etc. On the other hand, they can be considered as roles if seen against the background of the entities that perform them; for example, in 'The car is moving slowly', 'move (verb) denotes change in space. In 'The key opened the door', 'open' denotes causation (that is, the key causes the door to open). Based on the the situation-role theory, whose concepts are semantic categories and semantic-roles as listed and symbolised above, sentences can be symbolically formalised to show their semantic structure (thst is, pattern), as in the examples below. (The upper-case symbols are from Table 5.4 and the lower-case symbols are from Table 5.3). Sentence: He turned a traitor. Formalization (that is, semantic structure): Vh Gq Sentence: The ball hit me on the head. Formalization (that is, semantic structure): Zr Wh Rl The formalization above corresponds to the sentence structure SVC and SVOA respectively on a one-to-one correspondence. This correspondence is called syntaxsemantic isomorphism. The semantic situation-role theory has practical implications for lexicon (vocabulary) and dictionary making. In terms of lexicon, it is possible for one to choose to compile a lexicon (vocabulary) of a plant object, e.g. 'leaves'. It will not make sense to compile the terms of all leaves, but for a particular type of leaves, and in a particular way. For instance, in Runyakitara, it makes sense to compile the specific names of leaves of types of plants. Examples are ( Ry/Rk Ry/Rk ): amashansha (banana leaves) - amababi g'emitumba (leaves of a banana tuber) ebishuusha (pumpkin leaves) - amamabi g'ebihaaza/ebyozi (leaves of pumpkins) This kind of compilation is a called a subject dictionary, or a lexicon in general terms. For a defining dictionary, the semantic situation-role theory has the implication that meanings of words can be determined on the basis of the action that impacts on an entity. For instance, in 'The car is moving slowly' we know that 'to move' is to change in space relative to a location. For a 'car' in particular and other things which 'move', the definition of 'to move would be to go from one point to another'. A new meaning can also be sought if a different entity were the one undergoing the action (of the verb), e.g. 'The time is moving slowly'. In this case, 'move' means 'to complete a cycle'. It shows that if a different entity other than the normal entity performs the action, the implied meaning changes. This is an aspect of metaphoricity, and therefore meaning extension. How is this? 'move' as an example, is normally in relation to concrete objects if they change in space from one position to another. A non-concrete object such as time cannot be said to 'move' in this context. In cases where this verb is used to refer to time or any other non-concrete object, then the intended meaning is metaphorical (an extension of the basic meaning). Also, it is possible to use the semantic situation-role theory to write a systematic thesaurus. For instance, in terms of synonyms, the words 'price' (n.) and 'measure' (n.) may not belong to the same domain (that is, semantic category) of quantity objects if they are looked at from the perspective of their meaning. If 'price' is meant to mean 'value' it needs to belong to the abstract objects. But if it is meant to mean 'figure' (as in price tag), it needs to be put under quantity objects. Therefore, the specific meaning of words will be the basis of grouping words as synonyms under the different domains. This explains why 'price' and 'measure' may not be synonymous in certain cases. Indeed, it is the reason the two words are not direct synonyms of each other in the following list of synonyms recorded in Fergusson (1986, p. 323) demonstrated below. price, n. cost, expense, fee, rate, charge, value, worth, amount, figure, expenditure, outlay, valuation, assessment, estimate, quotation, bounty, reward. measure, n. size, magnitude, quantity, amount, extent, degree, scope, range. Using semantic categories to identify synonyms, it is justified to have the word endorero (Runyankore-Rukiga) being a synonym of ekifumuka (Runyankore-Rukiga) and vice versa. This can be judged from their meaning below as portrayed in Oriikiriza (2007, p. 161), whereby the meaning situates the words in the domain of material objects: endorero (n.) Akahengyere aku baabire bafumura omu kisiika ngu abakazi bareeberemu abagyenyi omu ... ibanga, ahabw'okuba bakaba bataikirizibwa kuzayo kubareeba nari kubahikaho. (A hole in one of the rooms in the house, which was used by women to see visitors. Women were not allowed to see visitors or come close to them.) Ekifumuka ky'orwigi eki baabaire bareeberamu enyamaishwa nari omuzigu aheeru nyekiro. (A hole in the door through which one observed an animal or enemy when it is outside at night.) According to the meanings above, the word endorero is a sub-set of ekifumuka. The latter includes the meaning of the former. Nonetheless, they depict entities that belong to the same domain, i.e. material object. Similarly, the Runyoro-Rutooro word enkamyo (n.) would belong to the domain of material object and plant. It is given in Ndoleriire et al. (2009, p. 44) with the following senses, which can be a justification for this: enkamyo (n.) (1) sour milk, (2) a plant used to turn milk sour. Clearly, in terms of semantic isomorphism of language, the semantic role-theory of language is reflective of situations that happen independent of language. It tells us of the phenomena (objects/entities) that exist in the real world independently outside language, but which are encoded in language (for purposes of communication). In the world of a Runyakitara speaker, there are objects/entities whose names have been illustrated through examples. The examples are, therefore, part of the vocabulary of Runyakitara. An attempt has been made to show how this vocabulary can be categorized systematically into ways in which the mind divides up all things. This has been done on the basis of the semantic situation-role theory. In the next section, emphasis now will be put on situations that take place and how they are encoded and expressed in language. The analysis will be based on the semantic situation-role theory (explained in the preceding section), with examples taken from English and Runyakitara. Situations, their Encoding and Expression in Language Events happen independent of language. For instance, the event (that is, the situation) of a leaf decaying or water boiling.

It is the ame in Runyakitara for sentences like: Omwana yaarira (The child has cried); and Omuti gukooma (The tree dried up). Basing on the situation-role theory, we can show the propositional form of the situations expressed by the sentences. Also, it is possible to show the sentence patters for the propositions. The propositions indicate how the situations are encoded in the mind. Below are examples of sentences from Taylor (1985) and Rubongoya (1999) which are used to illustrate propositional forms and their equivalent sentence patterns.

In relation to isomorphism of language, semantic change is indicative of change in phenomena. Therefore, it means that change in the real world influences a change in language. In the case of words, a change in their meaning is a result of a change in a situation or practice that exists. In the subsequent paragraphs, the content is aligned to changes in the meanings of words to illustrate changes in practices and conceptions. Byakutaga (1996) gives the following Runyoro-Rutooro examples of semantic change. Table 5.5: Runyoro-Rutooro examples of semantic change", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Causes of Semantic Change", "completion": "Byakutaga (1996) gives the following causes of semantic change. Development of new concepts (e.g., in the case of ebyaitu) above. The development of new practices (e.g., in the case of entomi) above. Development of new innovations (e.g., the use of computer which apparently was named kalimagezi in Luganda). It is said that originally the word kalimagezi referred to someone who is bright (oyo omwana mugezi 'that child is bright'). The meaning of kalimagezi was extended to mean computer. The examples above in Byakutaga (1996) denote meaning extension of words. Over time, words do extend in meaning. This process is called meaning widening (or broadening). Below are the different ways in which words change in meaning, as described in Murray (1996). The different ways are taken to be the types of semantic change. (i) Semantic broadening: It refers to a process by which a word gains a new sense, in addition to its previous sense or senses. For Runyakitara, the examples in Table 5.5 above, are cases of semantic broadening. A word gains a new meaning without losing its former meaning. (ii) Semantic narrowing: It is a process by which a word loses any of its senses which it used to have. In Runyankore-Rukiga, the word omwigarire which used to mean 'king's wife', today refers more to 'handmaid of God' in the religious sense (Christianity) than its former meaning. Similarly, the word omushumba which used to mean 'employee' and 'cow-herder', today refers more to 'pastor' (in Pentecostalism) than to the former meanings. The former meanings of these words are getting more obsolete, and this portrays gradual semantic narrowing. (iii) Semantic shift: It refers to the process in which a word loses its former meaning, and takes on a new, but often related meaning. For example, in Runyankore-Rukiga the word omukago meant a blood-sealed friendship, but today it means any form of close friendship. Similarly, the word okuramya meant worshipping a traditional god, but today it means Christian worship. (iv) Semantic weakening (that is, suppression of meaning): It is a process by which the meaning of a word is suppressed in terms of its actual sense. In RunyankoreRukiga, the meaning of the word omuhuuku (male slave) is relative to a captive who has been turned into a slave. Today the word is used to mean 'servant' in jocular circumstances when a person wants to tease the other, telling them that he/she is not their servant. In this case the former meaning is suppressed. Incidentally, this trend of usage of the words is steadily gaining momentum. In religious terms (Christianity), the word omuhuuku is constantly used to refer to 'servant of God' or to 'those who are humble before God'. However, this trend of change of meaning has not affected the word omuzaana (female slave) which is the direct opposite of the word omuhuuku (male slave). The latter tends to be used to collectively refer to both males and females whenever used, thus supressing its actual sense. Another example in Runyankore-Rukiga is the expression abanyabuzaare n'abanyamikago, which in its strict sense means 'relatives and friends'. It is normally used as a phrase in announcing the death of someone, but whenever it is used the sense that is carried is: 'all the people who know the deceased' other than 'relatives and friends'. (v) Semantic pejoration and amelioration: The process whereby a term acquires pejorative meaning (i.e., donates disapproval) compared to its ameliorative meaning. In the Runyankore-Rukiga religious discourse, expressions like abairu baawe (your servants) have an ameliorative sense. Traditionally among the Banyankore (Uganda), the word omwiru (a materially poor person) carried a pejorative sense. With the coming of Christianity, it is adopted in expressions like omwiru wa Ruhanga (God's son or daughter) in an ameliorative sense. (vi) Metaphorical change: It is a process by which a word with a concrete meaning takes on a more abstract sense, although without losing its original meaning. The word okuhweza (to visualise) in Runyakore-Rukiga has a concrete meaning, i.e. 'to see with one's eyes'. The speakers may use the word in constructions such as Abo bakahweza kare; baine entunguuka (Those became clever; they have developed). In this sense okuhweza means to be 'quick-witted'. This is a more abstract and recent meaning denoting metaphorical change. (vii) Loss of lexical items: This refers to words which are no longer used in a language. The words enyamuziga (bicycle), engondoore (ram) and ekizibaho (coat) are examples of Runyankore-Rukiga words that are now obsolete. New words, instead, are used to mean the same entities; i.e., egaari, empaya y'entaama and egooti/ekooti respectively. The processes of lexical change (as described above) form part of semantic change. Semantic change causes language change. Whether it is lexical change or semantic change, there is need to examine the intrinsic factors that underlie these processes. Taking an example of entomi (fist) in the examples above, the entity it refers to denotes a biotic object. It extended in meaning to 'bribe', which denotes a material object. This change is indicative of new phenomena that happen in the real world and how it is encoded in the human system of communication (that is, language). The new phenomena happen independent of language. Their encoding or conceptual existence (Namyalo, 2014) in the language is consequential with the occurrence of the phenomena. The phenomena (or situations) that take place in the real world can be new. They can also be old, or intermediary (neither old nor new). They can be positive or negative. They can be relational. The phenomena that get out of place in the real world cause a concurrent effect in the language. For instance, in the case of word loss, words are less used, and eventually get lost, leading to word loss. The theory of linguistic isomorphism as explained for language change, word classification (word domains) and sentence structure applies to other semantic features of language. These are meaning relations which include antonymy, synonymy, hyponymy/hypernymy, semantic incompatibility, among others described below.", "category": "Grammar"}

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Antonymy", "completion": "Antonymy is the relationship of oppositeness of meaning. Antonyms are opposite word forms in a language. Examples of antonyms in Runyakitara include omutsigazi (young man) versus empangare (grown up girl), omushaija (man) versus omukazi (woman). Antonyms therefore denote oppositeness of concepts. The concepts may be concrete or abstract objects that exist in the real world as the examples above would indicate. That is to say that there exists a pair of entities, e.g. 'girl' and 'boy' in the world. For purposes of communication, they have names in the language. The names must be opposites of each other since the entities they refer to are. Crystal (2003) identifies gradable antonyms, complementary antonyms and converse antonyms. The work goes ahead to define them as follows: Gradable antonyms show the expression of degree, e.g. small/big, wide/narrow, Complementary antonyms express binary contrast, e.g. male/female, single/married. Converse antonyms include terms whereby the meaning of one presupposes the meaning of another, such as sell/buy, parent/child. Much of these examples represent entities or ideas which are in the real world in terms of physical size ('big' or 'small'), physical binary contrast ('male' or 'female') and sequence of things ('sell' and 'buy'). In the following section, examples of antonyms in Runyakitara are listed. Their translation and categorisation show how they also lend themselves to the theory of linguistic isomorphism, i.e. that their meaning and relationship cast the entities that are in the real world and their nature of juxtaposition.

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Synonymy", "completion": "Different from antonymy, synonymy is the relationship of sameness of meanings of words (Crystal, 2003). Hurford and Heasley (1983) define synonymy in specific terms. They render synonymy as the relationship of words in terms of the meaning(s) that they have in common. Here, the assumption is that not all meanings are the same between a pair of words. They give an example of 'hide' (v.) and 'conceal' (v.) which are not the same in all of their meanings. According to Palmer (1981) there is no perfect synonymy. Each word in a pair or group of synonyms will have a distinctive meaning from the other or others. The distinction may be in terms of dialectal differences, style, metaphoricity, among others. Runyakitara examples for synonyms based on the strict definition of synonymy are as follows: When the words in the pairs above are analysed, they are not exactly the same in meaning. Each will have a slight difference in meaning. Some of the factors that influence synonyms in Runyakitara are: (a) Word borrowing: Some words are loan words in Runyakitara. For instance, kuyamba (help) is a loan word both in Runyankore-Rukiga and Runyoro-Rutooro. (b) Dialectal differences: For instance, omugyera (river) is predominantly used in Runyankore, whereas its counterpart omurindi (river) is predominantly used in Rukiga. (c) Social usage: In Runyoro-Rutooro some words are synonyms of others as a result of the palace language. For instance, okufa (die) is synonymous with okutu uza uza (die) used in the case of the death of a king in Bunyoro and Tooro. Synonymy implies that a word has the same meaning as the other; at least one of its meanings if it is a word with multiple meanings. Even if it does not have multiple meanings, still it will have a sense in which it is similar and different to the other in meaning. Synonymy is an aspect of words (language) which originates from the realities of what is in the real world (linguistic isomorphism). We will take the meanings of 'hide' (v.) and 'conceal' (v.)

The objects represented by hyponyms and hypernyms exist in the real world, but their meaning is described in words. For instance, 'a car' exists as a single object 'car', and 'a vehicle' is any object that moves by the power of an engine. Much as each exists singly, it is part of the others whose collection forms a virtual form. Therefore, the word 'vehicle' represents what exists in the real world in virtual form. Like other languages, Runyakitara words denote entities that have concrete and virtual existence in terms of hyponymy and hypernymy. The word ente (cow) has the latter quality.

Examples of words with multiple meanings can be cited in Rubongoya (2013) as shown below. okwetumbura (v. refl.) to pride oneself, flatter oneself on, stand on tip toe; pluck up courage; abantu abamu kwetumbura kubagiza ensoni (some people regard flattering oneself as a shameful thing.) okugaba (v.i) to distribute, to give away, to contribute, give in marriage, send out (army); ebintu bye abigabira abanaku (he/she gives his/her belongings to the poor); ija ongabise ebyokulya (come and help me distribute food). okutagaarra (v.i.) to take up much space, spread out, extend; abaikaarra omumotoka bafunzire tibatagaraza maguru gaabo (those who sit in a car in excess do not spread out their legs). The relationship of multiple meanings of words lies in the conceptual sense that cuts across the set of the meanings of a polysemous word. In the examples above underlying concepts are 'stand out' for okwetumbura, 'give out' for okugaba and 'spread apart' for okutagaarra.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Homonymy and homophony", "completion": "While other sense relations involve the shape of the meaning of words, others involve the relationship in the shape of the words themselves. The latter sense relations are referred to as homonymy (that is, the sameness of the shape of words). Homonyms are of different types, namely, homologues and homomorphs. Homologues are of two sub-categories: homographs and homophones. Homographs are different words with the same spelling. Homophones are words of different spelling but with the same pronunciation. Crystal (2003) offers the following examples for English language: 'bank' (building) vs 'bank' (ground), and 'threw' vs. 'through' for homophones. Homomorphs are same shape of words belonging to different parts of speech, e.g. 'water' (n.) and 'water' (v.) Although different in shape, homonyms as words represent different entities in the real world. However, the language form makes them similar or different in shape. The origin of the shape for homophones may be quite clear: similar pronunciation of words. The same goes for homomorphs, which are a result of conversion. It is not clear what the origin of homographs is. Lyons (1977), Crystal (2003) and Soanes (2001) trace their origin under etymology. Lyons (1977) gives an example of 'port' 1 (harbour) and 'port' 2 (kind of fortified wine) which are distinct words. It is maintained in this work that the former is derived from Latin (portus 'port') which is a reconstruction of the form ford (Modern English), while the latter is derived from 'Oporto' the name of a city in Portugal through which wine was exported. It is also noted in this work that the name of the city came from the Portuguese expression 'o porto' which meant 'the harbour' and originated from Latin 'porto'. From this background we note that since the words in question denote unrelated concepts (harbour and drink, wine) each concept needs a different name; that is, word. Therefore, instead of having one word for both meanings (polysemy), each is denoted by a different word (homonymy). In Runyakitara, words are spelt according to how they are pronounced unlike in English, for instance, where it is not the case. There is no mismatch between phonetic and phonemic representation in Runyakitara. Runyakitara words such as omukama (king) have letters represented by the same grapheme as the sounds. But the word 'Chemistry' in English has sound /k/ /k/ which is represented by ' ch ' as the grapheme. Therefore, a language with matching phonetic and phonemic representation as Runyakitara is not expected to have homophones. Homomorphs are also not expected since they come about as a result of stress placement. Being a non tresstimed language, Runyakitara is not expected to enlist homomorphs. Runyakitara has homographs such as shown below for Runyankore-Rukiga: omuti (tree)/omuti (concentrated banana juice), engoma (drum)/engoma (throne), amahembe (horns)/amahembe (witchcraft)/amahembe (bicycle handlebars). To be noted is that homography involves words each of which represents an independent entity in the real world. Homographs are to the language, while the entities they represent are to the world. Again this equals to linguistic correspondence between language structure and phenomena (linguistic isomorphism).", "category": "Grammar"}

In each case, the language structure has been presented, and commented on in terms of how it is a representation of phenomena that exist in the world environment of the speaker. Several more linguistic insights have been arrived at in this chapter. They include criteria for determining linguistic meaning, approaches to compilation of thesauruses, compilation of a lexicon, encoding/expression of meaning, examples of semantic change and meaning relations in Runyakitara, among others. The chapter portrays that the occurrence of phenomena is independent of language, but language is used to express it for purposes of communication. The implication of this is that the more we study the language the more we appreciate it and use it to communicate better.", "category": "Grammar"}

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Introduction", "completion": "Translation is defined by Pearsall (2001, p. 1969) as \"a written or spoken rendering of the meaning of a word, speech, book, or text, in another language\". On the other hand, Babcock (2002, p. 2429) defines translation in two forms: As a verb, \"a rendering from one language or representational system into another\". In other words, translation is to turn into one's own language or another language; to make a new version by rendering into another language. And as a noun, translation is an act, process, or instance of translating as a rendering from one language or representational system into another. Translation is an art that involves the recreation of a work in another language for readers of a different background. According to Bassnett (1991), translation is the rendering of a Source Language (SL) text into the Target Language (TL) so as to ensure that (1) the surface meaning of the two will be approximately similar and (2) the structures of the SL will be preserved as closely as possible but not so closely that the TL structures will be seriously distorted. On the other hand, Brislin (1976) defines translation as the general term referring to the transfer of thoughts and ideas from one language (source) to another (target), whether the languages are in a written or oral form; whether the languages have established orthographies or do not have such standardisation; or whether one or both languages are based on signs, as with sign language of the deaf. Venute (1995, p. 17) defines translation as \"a process by which the chain of signifiers that constitutes the source-language text is replaced by a chain of signifiers in the target language, which the translator provides on the strength of an interpretation\". Finally, Larson (1984) defines translation as a discipline that consists of transferring the meaning of the source language into the receptor language. This is done by going from the form of the first language to the form of the second language by way of semantic structure. It is meaning which is being transferred and must be held constant. Only the form basically changes due to the differences in the structure of different languages. The above definitions have a number of things in common. There is consensus among the different scholars mentioned above that translation involves transfer of information from one language (SL) to another (TL) and that the words used may not be the exact equivalents of what was in the SL. But there should be semantic harmony in both languages to make sure that the meaning in the SL is the same in the TL. The translator must avoid semantic shift, which would lead to misinformation. The setting of the text for translation should also be maintained, the styles, broadly speaking, must be equivalent, or comparable. The form, therefore, must be maintained in relation to the structure of a given language. Larson (1973) describes form as the actual words, phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, etc., which form the surface structure of the language. The translated version should therefore, have a dynamic equivalence if it cannot get the exact equivalents. What Does the Form of the Language Include? According to Larson (1973, p. 3), the form of the language includes \"the actual words, phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs etc.\", which form the surface structure of the language. For example, in the sentence: (a) The slow cat was knocked by a fast car. The actual words are: the slow cat was knocked by a fast car; and they form a sentence. This sentence is subdivided into subject and predicate, thus: This structure (of subject and predicate) too constitutes the form of the sentence. If we take a Runyakitara sentence like: (b) Omwana mubi akaiba omuyembe. The words: Omwana mubi akaiba omuyembe make the form of the sentence. Therefore, if we were to translate the first sentence into Runyakitara and the second sentence into English, the words would change their form. The English form would not remain as English, neither would the Runyakitara form remain Runyakitara. Therefore, the translations of sentences (a) and (b) would be as follows: English: The slow cat was knocked by a fast car. Rn/Rt: Akajangu akakaba nikagenda mpora emotoka erukwiruka muno ekakatomera. Ry/Rk: Akajangu akaabaire nikagyenda mpora emotoka erikwiruka munonga ekakatomera. You will notice that the structure of the sentences in Runyakitara has changed and is not like that of English. The number of words for both sentences is different from those in the source text. Whereas in the source language there are nine (9) words, in the target languages, they are eight (8) (in Rn/Rt) and eight (8) (in Ry/Rk). It should be noted that even if the number of words had been equal with those in the source text or less, still there would be a change in form. One important point to note is that, whereas the form of the source text changes in language, the meaning does not change. This is because, if the meaning was to change, then the intended message would change. Thus, the rule to remember in translation is keeping the original meaning as original as possible, even if it means changing the form. For example, in the following translated sentences, the form and structure are maintained but the meaning drifted. For all the sentences, the form has been maintained but the meaning has shifted, which has distorted the intended message. Thus, according to Larson (1984) in Rwomushana (2004, p. xiii) Translation consists of studying the lexicon, grammatical structure, communication situation and cultural context of the source language text, analysing it in order to determine its meaning and then reconstructing this same meaning using the lexicon and grammatical structure which are appropriate in the receptor language and its cultural context. In that context, the proper translation for the above example should be as follows: i) English: The old dog bit me Ry/Rk: Embwa enkuru endumire iii) English: One by one makes a bundle Rn/Rt: Kamu kamu nigwo muganda. It should be noted that the source language is the one from which the translation is made and the receptor or target language is the language into which the translation is made. However, you may have noticed that whereas in the source language one form may be expressed by one word, in the receptor language, it may be expressed by more than one word and vice versa. For example: Ry/Rk: Ekitabo ky'omwegyesa The teacher's book The book for the teacher The book which belongs to the teacher The book owned by the teacher. All these are different forms expressing one meaning. Due to differences required in form to convey a certain meaning, the translator must choose the best form which expresses the meaning in the most natural way in the receptor language. In doing this, the appropriate vocabulary, idioms and expressions, must be chosen to put the message across.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Reasons for Translation", "completion": "There are various reasons that justify why documents should be translated from one language to another. These include the need for accessibility. Most innovations take place in a language the person who has innovated speaks or uses. In most cases, all that information is in that language. Unless the innovation is rendered into another language, the innovation may remain in the source language and yet the beneficiaries of the innovation speak a different language. Innovations can therefore, be accessible to other languages if there is translation. Secondly, new inventions are usually accompanied with instructions on how to use a product. However, the inventers may not speak more than one language and yet what they have invented is for usage across the globe. Such instructions can be followed if they are written in a language that is understood by many people. This is important especially when it comes to medical prescriptions. Thirdly, translation is a discipline in its own right. There are some people who have specialised in translation. At the same time, translation is one of the activities that are time consuming and require skills, knowledge and good command of both the source and target language. This exercise, therefore, cannot be offered free of charge. Those who engage in translation have to be paid. The fourth reason for translating is that some written information and knowledge can only be accessed if one knows the languages it is written in. In certain cases, some languages are dead. The only way information or knowledge of that nature can be retrieved is through translation. For example, Latin is a dead language; it has no native speakers who use it as their mother tongue; but there are documents still written in that language. It also continues to be taught in schools. Documents written in Latin can only be accessed when translated. Lastly, sharing information comes about due to diversity in languages. In Uganda alone, there are four main language groups. Within these languages, there are dialects whose level of mutual intelligibility is low. With English as the official language and yet local languages dominate social discourse, access to information can only be achieved through translation. Likewise, some information that is in international languages can be shared if translated. For example, the Bible is the most widely translated book in the world yet its source languages are Hebrew and Greek.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: History of Translation in Uganda", "completion": "According to Bassnett (1991), translation studies cannot be complete if not considered in a historic perspective. Translation, according to Jacobsen (1958) in Bassnett (1991, p. 43) \"is a Roman invention\". However, Bassnett (1991) notes that there is a conflict between the Romans and the Greeks who accused the Romans of lack of creative imagination with arguments based on whether translation is either word by word or sense by sense transfer of message. It is noted that the first widely translated works were the translation of the Bible. It initially started with St. Jerome's New Testament Version which was launched by Pope Damasus in 384AD, which followed sense by sense transfer of messages. However, a paper presented by Pardo (2013) notes that Nida and Taber (1969) place the beginning of translation to the translation of the Old Testament Bible from Hebrew to Greek that was done by seventy translators. In Uganda, the Bible has been the most widely translated book. Most of the main languages have a translated version. The Bible Society embarked on translating it into all the languages of Uganda that have an orthography. It was first translated into Luganda and its first section came out in 1887. In 1893, the New Testament was published and the complete Bible was first published in 1896. This was followed by Runyoro Bible that was published in 1913. The Runyankore-Rukiga Bible was published in three parts with the first part coming out in 1957. This was followed by the New Testament that was published in 1962 and the full version was published in 1964. In 1989, it was revised and Apocrypha books were translated and included. The Bible in Acholi was published in part for the first time in 1905. The New Testament was first published in 1933 while the whole Bible was first published in For the Lango language, part of the Bible was published in 1967. The New Testament was first published in 1974 while the complete Bible was first published in 1979. Lugbara had the first part of the Bible published for the first time in 1922. This was followed by the New Testament that was first published in 1936. In 1966, the first complete Bible was published. Ateso got the first part of the Bible published in 1910. In 1930, the New Testament was first published. The complete Ateso Bible was first published in 1961. Other languages that the Bible was translated into are Ngakarimojong, Rufumbira, Rukonjo and more recently, the New Testament was translated into Lusoga, Lumasaaba, Lugwere and Lusamia-Lugwe. Other literary works have also been translated from English into RunyankoreRukiga and Luganda. They include Washington Irving's Rip Van Winkle (1819) translated into Runyankore-Rukiga as Ruhondeeza mwene Busaasi by Ntungwerisho Yemima in 1962, Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart (1958) was translated into Luganda as Eby'edda Bisasika by B. J. Walakira in 1994, George Orwell's Animal Farm (1945) into Luganda as Amaka ga Bawansolo by C. Karinda in 1988 and Wole Soyinka's Trials of Brother Jero (1973) translated as Owooluganda Jero Wakati mu Bikemo by J. Kizza Mukasa in 1995, part of Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart (1958) into Runyankore-Rukiga as Eby'obuzaariranwa Nibihwerekyerera by Rwomushana E. in 2004, Song of Lawino Song of Ocol into Luganda as Omulanga gwa Lawino by A. Kiyimba in 2014. However, the examples show that only one genre of literature has been given a lot of attention, i.e. literary prose. This means that other genres of literature and other works of scholarship have not had a chance to share knowledge of this magnitude. The situation has possibly been so because, though RunyankoreRukiga has been written since the 1950s, it came to be established as an academic discipline in 1990 when it started to be taught as part of \"Runyakitara\" at Makerere University. Before this, there was no urgent need to translate works from other languages for academic purposes. As noted above, most of the works that have been translated fall within the discipline of literature. However, the current competitive global trends demand that people be adequately informed if they are to compete favourably. People must get empowered through information if they are to survive in what has been termed as a global village. People need to be empowered with basic knowledge and skills to progress. Most of the knowledge that drives the world today is not available in our indigenous languages but is in what are known as international languages. Yet, people operate in their local or indigenous languages. If the cycle of ignorance and poverty that is a burden to our people is to be broken, we must avail this knowledge to them in the languages in which they operate. This will lead to indigenisation of knowledge and may contribute to breaking the current cycle of poverty.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Types of Translation", "completion": "There are various types of translation in the translation exercise. Their classification is mainly governed by the purpose of the translation. According to Bassnet (1991) and Larson (1984), they are the following: The first type is referred to as Literal Translation. This type of translation is formbased. It is a word per word translation. It does not usually give the original meaning of the source text as languages do not normally have a one-to-one correspondence of forms because of the different syntactic forms. However, for purposes of linguistic analysis, one may need a literal translation. For example: English: The President of Uganda gave a table made of wood to his close friend. Rn/Rt: Mukuru w'ihanga lya Uganda akaha emeeza ekozerwe omu rubbaho ha we ali haihi munywani. Or English: What is your father's name? Ry/Rk: Ni riiha ryasho eiziina? As you have noticed, the literal translation does not make much sense in Runyakitara. The second type is Idiomatic Translation. This is a type of translation which tries to use the natural forms of the receptor language and tries to sound as natural as possible. According to Larson (1973, p. 16), \"A truly idiomatic translation does not sound like a translation. It sounds like it was written originally in the receptor language\". Therefore, in Runyakitara too, when we translate, we must sound as natural as possible. For example: English: No sooner had I sat down, than I was terribly attacked by thieves. Ry/Rk: Nkaba naayehuumuzaho nti, abashuma bantaahirira n'obukambwe. Rn/Rt: Nkaba nakaikarra nti, nkarora abasuma nibantaagura noobukambwe. The third type is Pragmatic Translation. This is sometimes referred to as idiomatic translation. It involves the treatment of technical documents in which information about something is transferred into another language for immediate use. Brislin (1976) cites an example of repairing a machine whereby the manual that helps in providing information can be translated from one language to another to enable the technicians repair it. In this type of translation, the translator tries to use the natural forms of the receptor language and has to be as natural as possible. For Example, while repairing an engine, it may have an instruction that is reflected in the sentence below, English: Replace with a new cup. Ry/Rk: Taho ekifundikizo ekisya. Ideally, a cup in Runyankore-Rukiga is ekikopo. However, when you are translating, pragmatism is important to get what could be its equivalent and you end up with ekifundikizo, which, in Runyankore-Rukiga is lid. The fourth type is referred to as Ethnographic Translation. This is the type used in explicating the cultural context of the source and second language versions. Brislin (1976) notes that it is used when there is a difference between the time and culture of the source and the target language. For example, while translating the Lord's Prayer, ' … ….give us our daily bread', it becomes ' … … otuheereze egabo yaitu y'obutoosha'. Bread is omugaati made out of wheat flour but egabo is simply food in RunyankoreRukiga. Because of the period when the Lord's Prayer was pronounced and having a different cultural set up, the equivalent words are of ethnographic nature. The fifth type is Aesthetic-Poetic Translation. This is a form of translation that contains heroic, couplet and dramatic dialogue. It is influenced by the effect of the poet. In other words, this form of translation puts into account the feelings and any information used by the original author and might digress quite a bit from source language. This form of translation is important when translating poems and songs where the rhythm has to be maintained. For example, Songs of Solomon: 2: 2-4, when translated, it becomes: English: Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, Ry: Nk′oku Nk ′ oku omuti gw'omucungwa guba omu kibira, English: so is my lover among men. Ry: na nkunzi yangye nikwo aba omu batsigazi. English: In his shadow I delight to sit, Ry: Nkashutama omu kicuucu kye nshemereirwe munonga, English: and his fruit is sweet to my taste. Ry: ebijuma bye byannurira. English: He brought me to the banquet hall, Ry: Yantaasya omunju y'obugyenyi, English: and his glance at me signalled love. Ry: yandeebesa amaisho ga Rukundo. Linguistic Translation is the sixth type of translation we shall consider. This type of translation is concerned with equivalent meanings of the constituent morphemes of the target language (TL) and its grammatical form. It is the form advocated for usage in machine translation because it applies in situations where the languages undergoing translation have the same level of civilisation. It is useful in languages that have a similar grammar and sentence structure, for instance, if one was to translate from Runyankore to Rutooro in the following sentence: Rn: Omwana onu agende Ry: Omwana ogu agyende", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: The Translation Process", "completion": "The fact that translation involves far more than a working acquaintance with two languages is aptly summed up by Levy (1963) when he declares that a translation is not a monistic composition, but an interpenetration and conglomerate of two structures. On the one hand there are the semantic content and the formal contour of the original; on the other hand, the entire system of aesthetic features bound up with the language of the translation. The above means that translation is not just something superficial or even artificial; you need to know both the source language (SL) and the target language (TL) very well. Muranga (1992) describes the translation process even more dramatically when he says that it involves moments of real trouble, even danger and difficulty, whenever the translator has to use all the creative powers at his disposal in order to salvage a meaning from the hazards of cross-cultural transfer. He notes \"... the translator is like a ferryman trying to ferry some people across a river. He must use all the paddling skills at his disposal and, in case of trouble, all his creative energy and wisdom in order to bring his passengers safely across\" (p.3). Nida and Taber (1969) provide a model that sums up the translation process with an illustration in Bassnett (1991, p. 16) as shown below. Figure 6.1: The translation process The process of translation is explained in the flow chart above. To execute the process, one needs the relevant linguistic and aesthetic, ethnographic, pragmatic skills. It shows that the SL text should be comprehended before any actual translation work begins. Thereafter, the text should be analysed in order to determine how it should be translated. After that, the process of transferring the message from the SL to the TL follows. This is accompanied by transfer of the message to the TL, without distorting it. The message in the TL must be at least approximate to that of the SL. This approximate dimension is emphasized by Bassnett (1991, p. 2) when she says that translation must ensure that \"(1) the surface meaning of the two will be approximately similar, and (2) the structures of the SL will be preserved as closely as possible but not so closely that the TL structures will be seriously distorted\". Larson (1984), for her part, explains that in translation, the translator needs to study and analyse the lexicon, grammatical structure, communication situation and the cultural context. This is done in order to determine the meaning, which is reconstructed using the lexicon and grammatical structure that are appropriate in the receptor language and its cultural context. On the other hand, Venute (1995) believes that a translated text is deemed acceptable when it reads fluently and when there are no linguistic or stylistic peculiarities that are not natural to the target language. The translated text must be transparent. In translation the final text should not reflect that it has been translated, it should sound natural and feel original. According to Hillaire (1931), the translator should consider the work to be translated as an integral unit and translate it in sections, asking him/herself before each section what the whole sense is that he has to render. He should render idiom-by-idiom and intention-by-intention, bearing in mind that the intention of a phrase in one language may be more or less emphatic than the form of the phrase in another language. This, therefore, shows that the translator of literary prose, for example, has the right to ignore some of the stylistic aspects of the SL text in order to conform to the stylistics and idiomatic norms of the receptor language that are most natural and acceptable in the TL. To sum it up, the process of translating should involve: i) Ability to understand the source language. ii) Knowledge of the receptor language. iii) Reading through the document identified for translation. iv) Identifying the language register. v) Identifying the intention of the author. vi) Identifying the level of understanding of the intended users of the translated version. vii) Identifying the hard-to-translate concepts. viii) Selection of the most appropriate terms/vocabulary to use. ix) Translation of the text into the recipient language. x) Proofreading the translated text. xi) Submission of the text. We should note that from experience, translation can be effective if the translator follows the following steps: Begin by reading through the text to be translated. This involves reading of the text so that you become familiar with it. The second step is identifying the language register. You should always endeavour to establish if the source text is legal, medical, religious, etc. This helps in choosing the appropriate vocabulary to be used. The third step is to knowing the target beneficiaries of the translation. This is important because it gives an idea of what type of language one should use. If the target is readers whose formal education is limited to primary level, there may be need to use simple language. The fourth step is identifying the required reference materials. Some translations require wider consultations. When a translator gets the text to be translated, it is important to identify the different resources that may be required to use during the process. It is imperative that the translator identifies the human resource that may be useful and contacts them. For example, if the text is legal, it is good to have a lawyer within reach. This also applies to medical texts. As a fifth step, it advisable to seek to know the likely consequences of your actions. As a translator, it is important to know the risks involved in misrepresenting facts. This is because a mistake can cost life or lead to imprisonment of an innocent person. For every document to be translated, ensure that it does not move an inch away from the original meaning. You are now ready for the sixth step, which is translating the work. If you are sure that all the above have been appropriately addressed, you should embark on the translation. This is followed by back-translation as the seventh step. This is the process of re-translating the work back into the source language. It is done by an independent person that has not accessed the original work whose text is what has been translated. It is usually a source of conflict. The back-translator may write a different text. When the back-translation is done, the most important aspect should be to establish that the texts are closely related. This is because it is impossible to get the original document as it was written initially; no two persons can think alike. Secondly, the structure of the SL and the TL vary from one another. The eighth and final stage is to harmonise the translation. After back-translation has been finished, it is important to get all the three texts together and harmonize the work to come up with a single working document. The translation and back-translation should be harmonised to reflect what was in the initial text. It is at this stage that translation is considered complete. After all that has been done, you should then ask yourself the following questions: i) Is the translation in the target language equivalent or similar to the text in the source language? ii) Will the intended beneficiaries understand the text? iii) Would they respond the same way if it was in the source language? iv) Would the translation have the same meaning if the text is back-translated? If the answers to the questions above are in the affirmative, then, the translation will have been accomplished.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Challenges in Translation", "completion": "The process of translation has its own challenges that are experienced. Various factors are responsible for this phenomenon. These include the following: a) Lack of concept in receptor language b) Translation of Figurative Language c) Existence of untranslatabilities d) Emotional torture The lack of concept in receptor language is the first major challenge. Although it has been said that a translator must try to sound as natural as possible, it is quite difficult to come up with the appropriate expressions because there is no one-to-one lexical equivalence across languages. There are times when the source text talks about a concept or object that does not exist in the receptor language. What does one do in such a case? For example: ST: The robot was talking like a human being. Which of the three sentences below translates the above sentence to the satisfaction of the speaker of Runyankore? Why? i) Erobboti ekaba neegamba nk'omuntu. ii) Ekyoma kikaba nikigamba nk'omuntu iii) Ekyoma ekimanywa nka robboti, kikaba nikigambira kimwe nk'omuntu. Beekman and Callow (1974) suggest three possible ways of dealing with the problem of lexical equivalence: Usage of a generic word with a phrase; Usage of a loan-word; or Usage of a cultural substitute. a) Usage of a generic word with a phrase There are times when a translator has to translate a concept or idea which does not exist in his/her language. He/she needs to understand clearly the words and their meaning in the source language and how they are used in the different contexts. He/she needs to know the form and functions of the different lexical items in the language. The form of a word includes the physical attributes of the object being talked about. For example, the form of the car includes its size, colour, shape and its parts. But the function is to transport people and things. A translator needs to know well the functions and forms of words as they might differ from language to language. For one to come up with such a descriptive phrase of 'robot', he/she must know how the robot looks like and what it does. Thus, a translator needs to be widely read and very knowledgeable in various disciplines. At this stage, we need to note that even when the form and function of the lexical items are very much similar, they might have different associations in the two languages. For example, bread may be the same in both languages but with different functions. Whereas in Runyakitara bread may be a special treat for breakfast, in English it may be taken as daily food. If one chooses the generic term with a descriptive phrase to cater for the new concept being translated, there are various ways in which the generic term can be dealt with. As explained by Larson (1973), in the modification of form approach, the translator describes the generic form of the word to be translated. For example, if translated into Runyankore, it is: Another way in which a word could be translated is by making explicit its function. For example: In other instances, one may decide to use both the form and the function to describe a new concept in the receptor language. Thus, robot ekyoma ekikozirwe nk'omuntu ekirikukora buli karimo nk'omuntu. aeroplane ekyoma ky'amapapa ekirikugendera omu mwanya, ekitwara abantu n′ n ′ ebintu. The translator can also use a comparison of something in the receptor language to that in the source language. For example: ekitiiho tonto Or muha something like a big spoon a wine-like brew a dog-like animal. b) Usage of a loan-word There are times when a loan-word may be used to bring about lexical equivalence. When this is done, the word is usually modified to fit into the linguistic structure of the receptor language. Also, when the word is introduced, it is usually described. If you consider our first translation of 'robot', we used a loan-word with a RunyankoreRukiga description, thus: Ekyoma ekimanywa nka robboti, kikaba nikigambira kimwe nk'omuntu. After the introduction of such a word in the language, it is later assimilated as a borrowed word. In the translation of the Draft Constitution (1993), many loan-words were adopted as Runyakitara words and they are now being used. Words like Konsitityusoni (Runyoro-Rutooro), Konsitityushoni (Runyankore-Rukiga) have since been incorporated into the vocabulary of the receptor dialects. c) Usage of a cultural substitute There are times when any of the above-mentioned possibilities does not seem appropriate. Here, the translator may choose a cultural substitute from the receptor lan- guage. However, the translator must be very careful as sometimes the cultural substitute may not give the near equivalent, especially if the term does not exist. Thus, Larson's (1973, pp. 163-176) guidelines should be taken into consideration: i) How similar are the two things or events? If there is no similarity between the events and things, the translator must be very careful about the terms he/she chooses. For example, \"a red-carpet welcome\" - cannot be translated as: Okutangirira kw'ekirago kirikutukura. Rather, it is translated as: Okutangirira okw'ekitiinisa ky'amaani. ii) Could a descriptive equivalent be used without distorting the text? In this case, if a descriptive equivalent suits the situation better, it is advisable that it is used rather than the cultural substitute. iii) How culturally isolated are the speakers from the receptor language? The speakers from the receptor language may be living in a very remote area and have had very little interaction with the outside world. Even when an object is described by its function, it may be difficult for the speakers to understand what is being described. In this case, it would be better to use a cultural substitute. However, the translator is cautioned to be faithful to historical events. He/she should not change the truth of a historical fact because he/she wants to use a cultural substitute. For example, these are some of the cultural substitutes. The second major challenge faced by translators is associated with figurative language. This can be explained as a language that uses words, groups of words or expressions that exaggerate or alter the usual meanings with a meaning that is different from the literal interpretation. Figurative language can also bring about difficulties in translation. This is because the figures of speech such as metaphors, similes, idioms, allusions, hyperboles or puns may not always have corresponding equivalents in the source language and receptor/target language. For example, it may not be easy to translate an expression like \"it rained cats and dogs\" or \"I smell a rat\". Larson (1973, p. 254) suggests five ways of dealing with similes and metaphors, which are figures of speech: Keeping the metaphor if it sounds natural in the receptor language. Translating the metaphor as a simile using 'like' or 'as'. Substituting an equivalent metaphor from the receptor language. Keeping the metaphor and explaining the meaning. Translating the meaning of the metaphor without keeping the metaphorical imagery. The existence of untranslatable words is the third challenge that is faced during translation. Untranslatable words do not have an equivalent in the target language. This is because of the cultural uniqueness that exists. As a result, some words or expressions are in one language while they are not in another. When such a situation arises, it is imperative to get an expression that is equivalent. In case that is not possible, the translator has no option other than naturalising the word or expression. This means that the person writes the word as it is pronounced in the source language but follows the rules of orthography of the target language. The other alternative is to borrow from a neighbouring language. The fourth challenge to translation is emotional torture. This occurs when a translator, in the process of translation, has to translate texts that have emotional attachment. It may happen that one is hired to translate a document that may result in loss of life or property and the information is not yet published. The challenge would be whether to report such a situation to authorities yet it is against the ethics of translation where confidentiality is important.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Specialised Terminology", "completion": "From your daily experience of language usage, you must have noticed that different areas of specialisation use specialised terminology in their work. These include science, agriculture, economics, law, religion, medicine, biology, linguistics, et cetera. As a translator, one may be asked to translate texts from specialised disciplines. In this case, one needs to be well equipped with the vocabulary and meanings of the source text. And when translating the specialised terminology, there is need to keep it specialised in the receptor language. So, the translator needs to be precise and economical, at the same time relaying the original meaning of the term. The major problem arises when the terms to be translated are abstract in nature and are objects. For example, if a translator is given the following economics terms as extracted from Basic Economics for East Africa by Ddumba (2004), the likely equivalents in Runyankore-Rukiga identified for translation are as follows: a) Advantages (ebirungi): This term can be translated as ebirungi. However, the meaning is not as close to L1 as it should be. Ebirungi is basically \"good things\" and this is not the exact equivalent of \"advantages\". Another term would be ebirikuganyurwamu, from the verb okuganyurwa, which means payment for what you have done. The payment can either be monetary or benefits out of the activity. b) \"Economics\" as a term can be translated as Eby'obutungi. However, it does not come out in a natural way. Economics, when translated as ebyobutungi becomes synonymous with wealth, which is obutungi or eitungo. The term \"economics\" comes from Greek for oikos (house) and nomos (custom or law), hence \"rules of the house(hold).\" Its equivalent obutungi comes from the verb okutunga [o-ku- tunga] that could be explained to mean 'to get'. In Runyankore-Rukiga, the noun derived from okutunga is obutungi or eitungo, which is ownership of assets both movable and immovable. This form of wealth is for either an individual or a group of people or a country. Judging from the origin of the word economics, obutungi is more informative and extensive. A challenge, however, emerges between resources and economics where the two are polysymous in RunyankoreRukiga and the meaning is almost the same. c) Consumer (omukozesa): In Runyankore-Rukiga, this would literally mean 'the user' not 'the consumer'; but it is the only word that has the nearest meaning. 'Consume', in Ry/Rk would be okurya which is similar to 'eating' but the word consumer, which WebFinance Inc. defines as 'An individual who buys products or services for personal use and not for manufacture or resale' would contradict it since okurya, which in this case would be omuri has no relationship with consumption of services. Omukozesa still remains with another challenge as it may also refer to the one who has used something to do a particular work. A noun that would be used and fits well by embodying the consumption of goods and services is not available in the language. This would make the word being translated according to the context, and would not have a uniform translation, not even its immediate equivalent. d) Firm is translated as kampuni yet that would be the translation for 'company' which was naturalised. This is because 'firm' is a synonym of 'company'. In Runyankore-Rukiga, it is not possible to differentiate the two especially when they are serving the same purpose. Form and content do not change at all, as both remain nouns. e) Micro and Macro are free morphemes. Micro is a prefix in the International System of Units abbreviated as SI from the French Le Système International d'Unités and other systems of units denoting a factor of 106 10 6 (one millionth). 'Macro' on the other hand is the opposite denoting something big. In Runyankore-Rukiga, 'micro' does not have an equivalent term. It can best be translated as akakye. However, this does not suit the term as akakye is translated as 'small'. Akakye is not a prefix but an independent adjective. Likewise, 'macro' does not also have an equivalent but can be translated as ekihango. This, however, does not also suit the term. f) Poverty (Obworo) has a number of equivalents. In Economics, the term is used to refer to a situation of dire need. However, further description of poverty in Economics brings about concepts such as 'relative poverty' and 'absolute poverty'. Relative poverty does not have an equivalent and there would be a problem translating it. Its closest translation is obworo obutarengyesereize. This translation does not sound natural. On the other hand, 'absolute poverty', which is a noun phrase, has an equivalent in form of obukyene. This is just a noun. g) Products and Goods: These are different in English but in Runyankore-Rukiga, they are homophones. Both can be translated as ebintu. However, the products and goods have a monetary attachment to them and can be disposed of at any time while ebintu may not always attract a price tag on them. In other words, they may not easily be converted into money. h) Profits (Amagoba) is a straight forward term, as it has its counterpart word in L2. i) Aid (obuhwezi) stands out as 'help'. In Economics, aid is loan money. If one is to translate aid as loan money, the difference becomes obvious, as obuhwezi is not necessarily 'help' that requires a refund. In most cases, obuhwezi is free, whether it is in form of goods or services. j) Allowances (empeera): Whereas allowance is specific in English and means an extra pay that may not be tagged to a salary, empeera is payment for any work done. Although it is meaningful, it does not cater for payment of an allowance. k) Amount (omuhendo): The translation is direct and would apply in all circumstances related to transactions. Assets (eitungo): This idiomatic translation. However, it is not as straight as omuhendo. Eitungo in most cases refers to what a person owns in form of cows. Whereas the word 'asset' involves both movable and non-movable, eitungo does not go that far. m) Balance of Payments (Obwingane bw'entaatsya n'enshohoza y'ebitunziibwe aheeru n'ebiguzirweyo): This is a clear example of a definition turned a terminology. There is no word that can be used to describe balance of payments and is understood by a local person unless it is explained. n) Bank (banka): As a naturalised word, banka is understood by everyone. It is a new term that people had to learn. This is a recent naturalised term that would otherwise be eibiiko ry'esente. However, the maintenance of the English version in all places where banks exist has enabled the naturalisation. o) Bill (ekishare): The translation presupposes the amount of money that is being asked. Its back-translation in English would be similar to 'expected charges' or 'fees'. This is a clear equivalent word that works. It should be noted that whenever such terms have equivalents in the receptor language, it is advisable to naturalise them. That way, ambiguity would be avoided, since the user will be forced to read about the term from the source language. However, in a situation where the target language user does not understand the Source Language at all, he/she will be forced to inquire from those who know. It leaves no room for guesswork. The following could be the dynamic equivalents when translated into Runyankore-Rukiga.", "category": "Grammar"}

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Introduction", "completion": "Do we, as Banyakitara, need translation? It is estimated that more than 6,000 languages are spoken globally. Without translation, we can only communicate with those people who share with us a common language. Unfortunately, since the space for every language is limited on the world scene, some of the minority voices, which are less developed, with poor media access and are under-documented, would simply not be heard without this critical function. Africa has the highest language density in the world; more than 2,000 languages are used on the continent and more than 60% 60% of the population uses indigenous languages. These languages have remained mainly oral, informal in usage and under-published. Without translation, the creativity of African oral literature, its cultural novelty, and unique indigenous knowledge base will remain unamplified. Translation, in this case presents an opportunity to boost the image of African Languages and salvage the traditional wisdom, like that of the Banyakitara that is getting lost over generations. This work of preservation of the homogeneity of African thought has especially been effected through what Bandia (1993) terms the \"transference\" of African literature. He states that translating African creative works is a double \"transposition\" process, from the primary level of translation, that is the expression of African thought in a European language by an African writer; to the secondary level of translation, or the \"transfer\" of African thought from one European language to another by the translator\" (Badia, 1993). This is a practical way of demonstrating how translation theory embodies important values for our society. These are some of the applications of translation and interpretation that will be discussed in this chapter. The preceding chapter dealt with definitional issues, translation processes and professional registers in Runyakitara. This follow-up chapter will further investigate the relevance of translation in Runyakitara, the evolution of the discipline and its theories, translation and interpretation strategies, as well as recent developments in the field like audio-visual translation, in an attempt to link theory to application. In a study conducted in several African countries, 97.4% 97.4% of the respondents stated that greater access to translated information would help individuals to understand their legal rights, 95.18% 95.18% said it would improve the overall quality of life; 88.78% 88.78% of respondents said it would help prevent international, civil, ethnic, or communal conflict in Africa; and 63.7% 63.7% said it could have prevented the death of someone in their family or circle of friends. (Kelly et al., 2012). Indeed, not until Africa has access to such information can we say that we have emerged from the \"information famine\" and like the wealthy nations, we have got to the \"global information age\". This study suggests that \"it is only through translation that this disparity can eventually be eliminated\" (Kelly et al., 2012). In Uganda, the conditions to help us emerge from the prevailing \"information famine\" are far from being conducive.

The relatively high proportion of fiction books translated into Ugandan languages can be explained in terms of the newly introduced education policy requiring the use of indigenous languages as media of instruction in the early classes. Hence, the translations into Ugandan languages are for the most part translations of English school readers into Luganda, Runyankore-Rukiga and Ateso (Lapajian, 2010). These school readers are printed in large numbers, thus driving up the ratios of both English as a source language and Ugandan languages as target languages. The lesson to pick from this study is that the more the national and regional language policies go beyond discussions and speeches and get into practical application, the better it will be for the growth of translation studies in Runyakitara. Such suggestions on best practices to adopt for the future are best analysed when one knows the history of a discipline. The preceding chapter traced the history of Bible translation in Uganda as one of the beginnings of translation in Runyakitara. How does this link up with the global history of translation? Translation and Interpretation: A Historical Perspective Contemporary scholars in translation studies like, George Steiner, have now become more specific on the history of translation by distinguishing the discipline from the history of language. George Steiner (1975) for instance has divided the chronology of the discipline into four periods which we are going to adapt as our base for analysis in this chapter with adjustments: The first period refers to the time of the great Roman translators like Horace and extends for 1,700 years; The second period dates from the 1900s to the 1940s; The third one extends from the 1950s to the 1960s; and The fourth one dates from the 1960s to 2000;", "category": "Grammar"}

This period was specifically documented in Fraser Tyler's essay on the \"Principles of Translation\" in 1791 and it is the longest in translation history. It is characterised by its word-for-word and sense-for-sense translations. It emphasises the aesthetic criteria of the target language (TL) rather than the \"rigid notions of fidelity\". Early translators like Horace in his Art of Poetry, warn against the \"over-cautious imitation of the source model and slavish literalism\" (cited in As-Safi, 2011). This period concludes with the discussion of good translation as that \"in which the merit of the original work is so completely transfused into another language\" (Bell, 1991). From the above discussions, Tyler deduces three laws that are characteristic of this first period: The translations should give a complete transcript of the ideas of the original work; The style and manner of writing should be of the same character with that of the original work; The translation should have all the ease of the original composition (Cited in As-Safi, 2011).", "category": "Grammar"}

It is characterised by the focus on the theory of hermeneutic inquiry (from the Greek - to understand) and the development of a vocabulary and methodology of approaching translation. One theorist who was pronounced during this period is the French humanist Etienne Dolet who proposed the early principles of translation in \"La Manière de bien traduire d'une langue à l'autre\" (\"How to translate well from one language to another\"): The translator must fully understand the sense and meaning of the original author; The translator should have perfect knowledge of the both the source language (SL) and the target language (TL); The translator should avoid word-for-word renderings; The translator should use forms of speech in common use; The translator's words should choose and order appropriately words to produce the correct tone. These five principles were further summarized by John Dryden (1631-1700) in his \"Preface to Ovide's Epitsle\" into three categories of translation: Meta phrase, or turning on an author word-by-word, and line-by-line, from one language to another; Paraphrase or a translation with latitude, the Cicerian \"sense for sense\" view of translation; Imitation, where the translator can abandon the text of the original as he sees fit, \"between the two extremes of paraphrase and literal translation\" (in AsSafi, 2011).", "category": "Grammar"}

Translators in this period revised their approaches in order to include other disciplines in translation. This contemporary period has witnessed the emergence of a lot of new theories such as \"polysystem theory\", from a group of Russian literary theorists, offering a general model for understanding, analysing and describing the functions and evolution of literary systems and its application to the study of translated literature. The period also includes the \"skopos theory\" (from Greek purpose) developed in Germany in the late 1970s, reflecting a shift from mainly linguistic theories to a more functionality and socioculturally oriented conceptualisation of translation. Unlike the preceding periods where one school of thought was pronounced, in this contemporary period we notice the diversification of the theorists' orientation. This period also has experienced a marked increase in translation needs in the second half of the 20th 20 th century: the political, business, scientific, tourist, academic educational, religious and other needs that have increased significantly and they continue to increase as communication with \"the other\" gets faster, wider and more sophisticated. This is why this period privileges the principle of internationality in translation.", "category": "Grammar"}

This fifth period also coexisted with the fourth since advanced work by translation theorists, linguists, engineers, researchers, evaluators of end-user groups, professional translators, trainers and translation companies started to bear fruits in the 1940s. From that time, improvement of automatic machine translation of source text (ST) into target language has been on-going. It was improved with the assistance of man providing a post-editing semantically equivalent and well-formed text in the target language (TL). From the \"direct translation\" (morpho-syntactic replacements) of the 1950s, computerised translation has advanced to \"rule based approaches\" (rules of transfer for the particular pair of languages being handled) and \"corpus based approaches\" (using algorithms to match the new TL segments with the built-in SL segments) (Quah, 2006 cited in As-Safi, 2011). The early Runyakitara translations were mainly from the third and fourth period in the history of translation and as noted in the introduction, these were unfortunately not many. But the fifth period which is bringing with it a lot of open source materials and virtually translated \"documents\" is fast increasing space for minorities in the translation world. This is increasing the hopes of the unheard and \"untranslated\" voices.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Translation Theories", "completion": "From the existing literature, for almost two thousand years, translation theory had been merely concentrating on outstanding translated works of art. The science of translation, earlier on known as \"translatology\", did not emerge until the 1940s (AsSafi, 2011). In the actual sense of the discipline, however, the history of translation deals with: \"what translators say about their art/craft at different periods: what kinds of recommendations translators have made and how translation science has been taught\" (Baker, 2005). Translation theory is of importance to translators because it helps them to determine the appropriate translation method for the text or text-category in question. It is also important in providing \"a framework of principles, restricted rules and hints for translating texts and criticising translations, a background for problem solving\" (As-Safi, 2011). A rigorous theory of translation, in the case of Runyakitara, provides a practical evaluation procedure, with specific criteria, which indicates a certain level of accomplishment of the task under study. Eugene Nida (1976) seems to offer a good summary of translation theories when he observes that \"due to the fact that translation is an activity involving language, there is a sense in which any and all theories of translation are linguistic\" (Nida, 1976, p. 66). He goes on to classify these theories into three sub-categories which we will use in our analysis: philological theories, linguistic theories, and socio-linguistic theories. This classification depends upon the perspectives and approaches applied to the principles and procedures of translation discussed in the preceding chapter.", "category": "Grammar"}

In the case of Runyakitara, they will be mainly concerned with the comparisons of Runyakitara structures and those of other indigenous and foreign languages into which one is translating or interpreting. They will dwell on the functional correspondence, literary genre, stylistics and rhetoric. As Nida (1976) explains, instead of \"treating the form in which the text was first composed, they deal with corresponding structures in the source and receptor languages and attempt to evaluate their equivalences\" (Nida, 1976, p. 69).

He explains that such a theory of translation is essentially \"a theory of semantic transfer from source language (SL) into target language (TL)\" (p. 249). This is what has been termed the \"hermeneutic approach\" aiming at understanding a piece of oral speech or written text and the attempt to diagnose the [translation] process in terms of a general model of meaning (Steiner, 1975). Steiner approaches the act of literary translation \"in the context of human communication across barriers of language, culture, time and personality\" (Steiner, 1975, in As-Safi, 2011, pp. 297-413). He thus sub-divides the [hermeneutic] motion into four stages of: Assuring and determining the sense in ST, that has to be extracted; Invading, extracting the meaning and bringing it home; Incorporating new elements into the target linguistic and cultural system; and finally, Compensating or restoring in the target text what the translator failed to recover from the original text (Steiner, 1975).

These theories view translation as \"simply a question of replacing the linguistic units of the ST with the 'equivalent' TL units without reference to factors like context or connotation\" (As -Safi, 2011, p. 35). According to Nida and Taber (1969), linguistic translation contains elements which can be directly derived from ST wording.

In the text type argument, it is at the level of the text rather than the words, that equivalence and communication are effected. In the informative text for instance, the purpose is to communicate facts. Hence, when analysing an informative translation in Runyankore, one should check whether the translator has transmitted the full referential of conceptual content.

The audio-medial texts require a \"supplementary method\"; that is supplementing adequately with visual images, sound, music and action. In the words of Munday (2001, p. 16), \"the text type approach moved translation theory beyond the effect they create among the readers; going towards the consideration of the communicative purpose of translation\".

According to Hermans, under this theory, translation implies a degree of manipulation of the ST for a certain purpose, because its process aligns \"the target text (TT) with a particular model which should secure social acceptance in the target culture. This theory is descriptive, target oriented, functional and systemic\" (Hermans 1985, p. 11). In contrast to the linguistic theories, this one approaches translation not as science, but rather as an art which permits manipulation rather than rigid equivalences. Accordingly, translation is deemed a \"re-writing process and the translator a re-writer who can alter or manipulate the ST in such a way as to be acceptable in the target language and culture\" (As-Safi, 2011, p. 41).", "category": "Grammar"}

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: The Relevancy Theory", "completion": "This is associated with pragmatics which deals with the use of language in communication. More specifically, it deals with the way meaning is conveyed and manipulated by the participants in a communicative situation. In other words, pragmatics deals with the speaker's meaning and the way it is interpreted by the hearers through what is known as \"implicature\". The theory emphasizes \"the interpretative use of language as distinct from the descriptive use\" (Palumbo, 2009, cited by Allot 2003, p. 51). Baker (2005), points out that human communication is based on the ability of human beings to infer what is meant that may be accounted for through the principle of relevance, defined as achieving maximum benefit at minimum processing cost. The relevance theory tries to account for the way the information processing faculties of the mind enable us to communicate with one another. \"Its domain is therefore with the mental faculties rather than texts or processes of text production\" (Gutt, 2000, p. 21). From the foregoing, one can observe that each translation theory has its way of trying to balance the semantic content and the literary values of the original text. They represent sets of options for assessing whether the right word was chosen or the appropriate modification was effected. The correct application of these theories on Runyakitara consists of mastering the art of choosing the appropriate set of options available for a multi-dimensional assessment of the processes and product of translation.", "category": "Grammar"}

This section links the science and art of translation to the strategies adopted for the different text types. From the onset, it is noted that some scholars of interpretation refer to strategies as techniques or methods of translation. In this chapter, a strategy of translation is considered like a procedure that helps to solve a problem encountered in translating a text or its segment (Baker, 2005). There are local strategies which deal with text segments and global ones which deal with whole texts. In both cases, when one is translating, a strategy or technique needs to be selected to tap into the translator's background knowledge, his/her awareness of the register, content, the relevant linguistic conventions and his/her mastery of the language.

The original text is subjected to an adaptation so as to be re-cast and made compliant with the target linguistic and cultural conventions and to accomplish the purpose of translation. This strategy is often adopted by liberal translators as seen in the following translation of proverbs from Runyankore: Tingasiga tasiga ntoni The drunkard never misses hard fist knocks (Interpretation: If you keep going to every bar where alcohol is, you will not miss getting a hard fist knock because where alcohol is, the chances of fighting are high). Mpora mpora ekahisya oтиnyongororwa aha iziba Slow steps led the earthworm to the well (Interpretation: Hard tasks are accomplished by taking the first step) (Source: Africansoulmag.com Accessed on 12/12/2013) The translator has accompanied the proverb with an interpretation that is readily understandable by a contemporary foreign audience.", "category": "Grammar"}

In many legal, political, scientific and technical texts where translation loss is anticipated, compensation has been frequently utilised to make up for that loss. In the texts that have translated the analysis of the Rwanda genocide, for instance Taylor (1999), although the direct meaning of \"interahamwe\" was known to be \"those who work together\", the terminology has been left in Kinyarwanda, with a supplement of \"Interahamwe militia\" to give the political connotation of their military orientation.", "category": "Grammar"}

Many terms referring to cultural-bound values and practices of the Banyakitara have been approximated to equivalents which are accepted as natural\" in English but do not exactly transfer the same meaning to the English speaking Munyakitara. Terms like \"Omufumu\" who should have been a \"spiritual healer\" was approximated to \"diviner\" or at worst \"witchdoctor\" and \"okurunga\" equated with \"spicing\" when it actually does not involve putting any of the modern spices in the food.", "category": "Grammar"}

We now talk of going on \"safari\" using the \"kompyuta\" in Runyakitara and putting on \"Busuti\" like the Baganda and when you visit an Atesot friend you will drink their brew \"ajono\" and play \"omweso\". These events, dresses, foods, and sports have now become a familiar part of our daily life because of intercultural living and social proximity. However, Malone (2013, p. 1) warns, that \" … … the term will not conjure up the same association as it does in the source language\"... The second form of equation is provided by the \"calque\", where the target language adapts the source language term to its own morpho-phonological framework. The Runyankore \"okupaminga\" term for \"perming hair\" or \"kalituusi\" for eucalyptus have been accepted as common usage. Another example is the shout of acclaim \"Encore!\" from French in musical concerts in Uganda, which is dressed to cover the complexities of gender, plural and politeness markers that would otherwise be needed if another translation strategy was chosen for requesting a repeat. One of the most common risks associated with the word-for-word equation is that of false cognates (false friends), where the meanings of deceptively similar terms do not match across languages. The classic examples in Runyakore and Luganda are okushitama/okusitama, [sitting down/squatting] and kokareebe/koboine [it serves you right/what a pity] in Runyankore and Rutooro. To return to Malone's (2013) terminology, the antithesis of equation is substitution, adopted when there is no direct equivalence. For example, at a purely grammatical level, the Rutooro prepositional phrase replaces (substitutes) the English genitive: \"Acts of the Apostles'\" will be translated as Engeso z'Abakwenda. At a more semantic level, the proverb Atariho tagwerwa muti, in French is replaced by Les retardatires mangent les os [Literally: Late comers eat bones]. At the beginning of the Walt Disney Pictures version of 'Alice in Wonderland' (1951), Alice is given a song to sing, 'all about cats and rabbits'. If the film was to be done and Alice was to sing in Runyakitara, another simple and silly song would be chosen. The reasons for such changes are not merely linguistic or merely cultural relocation, but linguistic fidelity that can be rejected in the interest of a greater good, for the entertainment of children (Malone, 2013).", "category": "Grammar"}

Divergence represents a relationship of one-to-many. \"Okuhindura\", for instance, could mean to change, to exchange, to turn, or even, to translate. Where there is a whole set of possibilities, the translator's aim is to make the right choice. Convergence, on the other hand, represents a relationship of many-to-one. It is the opposite of Divergence. We could cite the case of French pronouns \"Tu, Te, Toi, Vous\" that all would converge into \"You\" when translating into English.", "category": "Grammar"}

Sometimes, a single lexical item in one language needs a 'collocational' partner in the other. Certain components may be cultural, semantic, linguistic, or a mixture of all. The amplification device is also found in technical translation in order to aid comprehension. Reduction, as the term suggests, consists of omitting elements in a target text because they are redundant or even misleading.

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Re-ordering", "completion": "The strategy of re-ordering, is within the field of comparative syntax. At its simplest, it requires the translator to operate basic inversion procedures with, for example, the adjective-noun sequences: white horse / embaraasi erikwera, and the verb-object positioning: Ninkukunda / I love you. Set collocations of two or more items exist in both languages: okufa n'okukira / life and death; ekiine ebirikwera n'okwiragura/ black and white; ahagati y'amaino ga rufu n'ekituuro / (between) the devil and the grave. The foregoing examples indicate how such pairings can sometimes match perfectly or match partly but belong very definitely in the same semantic field, and match perfectly but in an inverted form. The very frequent use of the passive voice in English creates another need for re-ordering in translating into Runyakitara since it has: its own identical passive forms; e.g., Abantu boona nibamukunda / He is loved by everyone; an active form using verbs with impersonal agents whose nominal or pronominal identity never appears; e.g. Tibakakingambiraga I have never been told that/They have never told it to me.", "category": "Grammar"}

Interpretation is much more demanding than translation in terms of competences required. The major requirements for a competent translator could be summarised as the mastery of SL and TL, thorough knowledge of source and target cultures, familiarity with the topic/register, vocabulary wealth, and awareness of the three-phase process: SL decoding, trans-coding or SL-TL transfer, and TL encoding (As-Safi, 2011). Simultaneous interpreting, on the other hand, requires at least five more skills: short-term memory for storage and retrieval, acquaintance with prosodic features and different accents, quick thinking and paying full attention, and self-composure.

The maximum acceptable relay-delay is 30 seconds after the floor language. The interpreter is therefore, often obliged to resort to compensation strategies in order to ease the burdens of constraint, achieve a smooth performance, maintain a fluidity of ideas and improve the pace of delivery. In this speech where the orator was making a list of the agricultural products of Mali, the interpreter compensated for the last item as it was unfamiliar to the Ugandan audience: .... les arachides, le mais, les haricots, le millet, et noix d'acajous .... groundnuts, maize, beans, rice, millet and other grain crops.", "category": "Grammar"}

It is essential for aspiring practitioners to understand the theoretical explanations in order to avoid making the same mistakes as their predecessors in practice. When teaching, the lecturer/instructor can actually pick and demonstrate strategies that can be used to overcome syntactic and semantic constraints, those for solving phonological, prosodic and phatic problems, and those to tackle paralinguistic and psychological constraints like tract and stage fear. In general, however, constant detailed reading assists the interpreter to familiarise with content and register, and to deal with the preliminary linguistic constraints. Other issues concerning accents, intonation, pitch, rhythm and tempo get to be solved as the practionner gets more accustomed to the profession.

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Audio-Visual Translation", "completion": "I have decided to end this chapter with a section on audio-visual translation because it seems to me to be a new area that is technically located midway between translation and interpretation. Yet it is a field which is attracting a lot of media attention as it is a fashionable channel of popularising Runyakitara using the new digital technologies and social-media networks. The advent of digital technology, especially the mass production of DVDs in Third World Countries like Uganda, has meant an increase in films, television programmes which are mostly in English, frequently with subtitles. But there are increasingly those with a diagonal (different language) sub-titling including Runyakitara. In addition, the term used for the interpretation played over the DVD orally, is \"dubbing\" (Ghaemi & Benyamin, 2010). Both these processes are combined under the category of screen or audio-visual translation (AVT). Screen translation, a translation method which makes use of the acoustic channels, as recognised by Baker and Hochel (1998, p. 74) has undergone a lot of rapid growth over the last two decades. This is certainly linked to the fact that it is the quickest and most economical strategy of translation and interpretation. Subtitling is defined as \"supplementing the original sound track with another voice, in another language\". Similarly, audio-visual transfer denotes \"the process by which a film or television programme is made comprehensible to a target audience who is unfamiliar with the original source\" (Ghaemi & Benyamin, 2010, p. 40). Technically therefore, these are processes which involve literary and figurative translation and interpretation. According to Gottlieb (1998 cited in Schwarz 2003, pp. 5-6), a subtitler is faced with formal (quantitative) and textual (qualitative) constraints: \"textual constraints are those imposed on the subtitles by the visual context of the film, whereas formal constraints are the space factors (a maximum of 2 lines and 35 characters) and the time factor\". Schwarz (2003, p. 5) goes on to add that \"the main problem in subtitling is caused by the difference between the speed of the spoken language and the speed in reading; both require a reduction of the text.\" In terms of benefits, scholars have demonstrated that, there are some advantages for watching subtitled language programmes. First, watching subtitled programmes fosters the practice of the language of the screen translation or interpretation. Secondly, such programmes can improve reading skills, in this case in Runyakitara. However, these benefits only apply if the subtitles meet the quality requirements. Pushing further Gottlieb's findings (2004), one can deduce that interlingual subtitling, which encompasses societal and language-political implications, is instrumental in improving reading skills, boosting language competences, facilitating easy and cheap intercultural exchange. Gottlieb goes on to propose the following translation strategies for subtitling films: Expansion is used when the original text requires an explanation because of some cultural nuance not retrievable in the target language. Paraphrase is resorted to in cases where the phraseology of the original cannot be reconstructed in the same syntactic way in the target language. Transfer refers to the strategy of translating the source text completely and accurately. Imitation maintains the same forms, typically with names of people and places. Transcription is used in those cases where a term is unusual even in the source text, for example, the use of a third language or nonsense language. Dislocation is adopted when the original employs some sort of special effect, e.g., a silly song in a cartoon film where the translation of the effect is more important than the content. Condensation would seem to be the typical strategy used, that is, the shortening of the text in the least obtrusive way possible. Decimation is an extreme form of condensation where perhaps for reasons of discourse speed, even potentially important elements are omitted. Deletion refers to the total elimination of parts of a text. Resignation describes the strategy adopted when no translation solution can be found and meaning is inevitably lost (Ghaemi & Benyamin, 2010). The most important challenge regarding subtitling in countries like Uganda, is the \"lack of responsible institutions and educated professional subtitlers at work\" (Ghaemi & Benyamin, 2010, p. 39). Secondly, most DVDs are subtitled using special software intended to exclude human interference. In situations where the technology is well developed, the quality of the translation is good. But in Uganda, where the subtitling in Runyakitara is mostly effected on pirated DVDs, using back street make-shift \"studios\", there is hardly any standard to be respected. Our interest in the present publication is to call on universities and other tertiary institutions to include the study of subtitling in translation and interpretation studies, so that professionals can be trained for such work. Educated subtitlers will not come into the realm of film, music and entertainment industry as long as screen translators and interpreters remain in the backstreet shadows hiding from law enforcement agents. They need to be recognized for their creative contribution to the image and sound productions and to be included in the curriculum of translation and interpretation studies.", "category": "Grammar"}

In terms of linking theory to practice in this chapter, the insights of Bassnett (2002) seem to be still pertinent to our conclusion: \"To divorce theory from practice, to set the scholar against the practitioner as happened in other disciplines, would be tragic indeed\" (Bassnett, 2002, p. 17). In this chapter we have tried to show that in the history of the discipline, the different theories that have been advanced and the strategies that have been proposed are crucial to training in translation and interpretation in Runyakitara. In the chapter, we have also illustrated how new areas in the discipline, like audio-visual translation and screen interpretation, which hitherto have not received serious attention, can bring forth economic, linguistic and socio-cultural benefits if they are promoted and formally incorporated in translation and interpretation studies.", "category": "Grammar"}

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Introduction", "completion": "Orthography is a set of rules or conventions put in place to prescribe how a language should be written. In other words, orthography is the system of representing the sounds of words by written symbols (Fromkin et al., 2003). The rules include how words that are in a spoken form should be spelt, punctuated and capitalized. Runyakitara, like any other human language, manifests itself in two forms: spoken and written. In the opinion of Fromkin and his colleagues (2003), these two forms are distinct in the following ways: The spoken language is the natural form of language while the written language is artificial. By referring to the spoken language as being natural, it means that it is innate (inborn) to human beings because when a child is exposed to it, that child will have the ability to communicate in that spoken medium. There is therefore, no teacher or instructor required to teach a child his/her mother tongue. On the other hand, written language is artificial because those who know it have to learn it in order to communicate using it. Written language is therefore, an invention of man that helps him to store information and disseminate it. Secondly, written language is not the original form of language. This is because it is a representation of the spoken form where human vocal symbols made by speech organs are represented on a piece of paper by graphic symbols. Because of that, it is impossible to find a written language which is not spoken, although it is possible to find a spoken language that is not written, especially if that language's orthography has not been developed. Thirdly, although a written language changes over time because the process of change is very slow, the spoken language easily changes. The written form of language is more conservative and resistant to change than the spoken form. Therefore, a written word is not only more permanent than a spoken one but is also rarely subjected to linguistic changes. Fourthly, in a written language, the user has a relatively wider range of graphic symbols which she/he uses. For example, there are more than 12 vowel sounds that are represented by only five vowels; a, e, i, o, and u. Written language is also uniform with all varieties of dialects of a language; for example, while the American English pronunciation is different from that of the British, the two forms do not significantly differ in spelling. This is not the case with the spoken form. Finally, spoken language cannot be informative per se mainly due to repetitions. This is because the spoken language does not have to follow the rules of grammar while the written language follows the rules as specified.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Principles of a good orthography", "completion": "Fromkin et al. (2003) explain different principles that make a good orthography. The first principle explains that a good writing system should accurately reflect the sound system of a language. It must be based on thorough analysis of the sounds of that language. It is not possible to make an accurate orthography without first analysing the sounds of that language. All contrastive sounds in a language should be represented and non-contrastive variations should not be represented. When the system is inaccurate, the reader is faced with a problem of guessing the meaning of the word. The orthography of Runyakitara has followed this principle as most sounds are represented by one symbol. The problem is on homonyms where more than two words are represented by one sound. A good orthography of a language should be consistent; there should be no contradictions within the system. This means that: a) The same sound should be represented by the same symbol. b) The symbol should never represent anything else except that sound. c) There should be no silent letters or letters that are without function. This is one of the principles that Runyakitara orthography adhered to. There are no two sounds that are represented by the same symbol The third principle is that a good orthography should be convenient to the extent that it is easy to write and symbols are easy to make. The symbols are also easy to print and type. Another principle of a good orthography is that it should conform to the orthography of the other languages in the region. It is not good for the orthography of a language to differ much with that of its neighbours. In the case of Runyakitara, the orthography conforms to all the neighbouring languages as they all use alphabetic writing system. The last principle of a good orthography is that it should be acceptable to the people who are going to use it. Often, people have strong opinions especially if there has already been an older orthography in use. Time must be taken to consult local opinion and to explain carefully the reasons for any proposed change. This was done in 1954 where disagreements emerged and Runyoro-Rutooro ended up writing their own and another conference was organised for Runyankore-Rukiga that got her orthography in 1964.", "category": "Grammar"}

In some instances, more information is added while in others, it is reduced or adulterated. Consequently, by the time the message gets to the intended recipient, it is no longer in its original form. Furthermore, for purposes of preservation of information, sometimes the only source of information might die without leaving any recording of his or her knowledge behind.

At that time, it was even thought that Luganda would be the major language of communication and instruction throughout the region. However, the reality was that very few people understood Luganda in the whole of Western Uganda at that time. Furthermore, with the consolidation of the reinstated monarchy in Tooro (reinstated by the British in 1891) and the rise of nationalism in both Tooro and Bunyoro, it was felt more and more that Luganda should be replaced by Rutooro and Runyoro as the major language for communication in the two kingdoms respectively. The writing of Runyakitara (Rubongoya, 1965), started with the Runyoro-Rutooro dialects before it spread to Runyankore-Rukiga. The Protestant Missionaries of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) spearheaded the writing of our languages in Tooro. The first version of the New Testament was translated into Rutooro by the missionary H. E. Maddox during the early years of evangelisation, around 1900. The same author produced the first grammar of the language in 1902 called An Elementary Lunyoro Grammar which was based on the Runyamwenge (essentially using the Runyamwenge sub-dialect of Rutooro). The year 1913 was very important in the history of Runyakitara when Maddox produced the full bible translated in Rutooro, also based on Runyamwenge dialect. The first bible was used in the whole of Western Region and some areas of the present-day Democratic Republic of Congo. Other books were subsequently written by both the CMS missionaries and the RCM (Roman Catholic Missionaries) but were generally in the Runyamwenge subdialect. These included the well-known Grammar Ey'Orunyoro by the Rev. Fr. A. Caumartin which is still of much value up to this day. Books and manuals produced at this time were usually for schools or for religious purposes. Some written work also appeared during the early years in Runyankore, e.g Omuntu na Hygiene published by the White Fathers Mission, Mbarara in 1935 and was intended for primary schools. The full translated version of the bible in RunyankoreRukiga came out in the 1950s.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Efforts to Standardise the Orthography of Runyakitara", "completion": "It was, according to Rubongoya (1965), R. A. Snoxall, the then Acting Director of Education, who in 1946, after consultations with A. N. Tucker, an expert on Bantu languages at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, who decided to introduce a new orthography. After discussions with missionaries and other educators in Buganda, the new orthography was adopted for Luganda. That very year, 1946, Snoxall organised another conference for the Western Region at Virika, Fort Portal, to discuss a standard orthography for the Runyoro language. It is in this conference that the representatives of Ankore and Kigezi stated categorically that their language was different from Runyoro and that accepting this new orthography would bring about the demise of their language which was already developing written materials. They added that the people in their areas were not prepared to read any book or newspaper written in Runyoro. According to Taylor (1960), the Virika Conference therefore, broke up without any decision being taken on the new orthography. However, from this period, as Betungura (1960) notes, Runyankore continued developing and came up with the first Runyankore-Rukiga orthography in a conference at Mbarara in 1954. This conference was chaired by Prof. A. N. Tucker and the secretary was K. S. M. Kikira. Thereafter, the colonial authorities started recognizing its importance in Ankore and Kigezi. In 1947 for instance, the Education Department of the Uganda Colonial Government authorized the use of Runyankore as a medium of instruction in Primary 1 and 2 in Ankore and Kigezi. This policy was clearly stated in the 1948 Education Report which recognized six vernaculars as media of instruction in Primary School. These were: Luganda, Lunyoro, Luo, Ateso, Lugbara and Swahili. The Education Report (1948) further explains that the limited production of literature made it clear that no further vernaculars can justify a claim to be regarded as media throughout the primary school system, but noted that the use of Runyankore dialect of Runyoro had been conceded for the first two years of primary school in Ankore, and would continue to be used only up to that level until when there would be sufficient materials written in Runyankore. This policy remained valid until the Castle Report of 1963 when RunyankoreRukiga was recognized as one of the six major vernaculars to be used in the school system (Swahili had ceased being recognized as a vernacular in Uganda in 1956). By this time, Runyankore-Rukiga had developed considerably and by the 1970s, it was somewhat in better position than Runyoro-Rutooro. After the break-up of the Virika meeting of 1946, the Banyoro and Batooro reconvened in Hoima in 1952 (six years later) to discuss again the problems of harmonizing the orthography, this time for Runyoro and Rutooro, which at this meeting had adopted the name Runyoro-Rutooro (rather than Runyoro) to cover the two dialects. At this meeting, the harmonization work involved such aspects as taking a common stand particularly concerning some of the symbols and signs used by the CMS missionaries and those used by the RCM. For instance, while CMS missionaries used the diacritic sign (-) to mark length on top of a vowel, the RCM (White Fathers) used (^) on top of the vowel. In accordance with the recommendations of the International African Institute, it was agreed that vowel length would be marked by two vowels. Some harmonization was also effected at the level of grammar to reflect the language usage of the Banyamwenge. We produce here some recommendations made at the Hoima meeting as reported by Rubongoya (1965). Many of the recommendations made in fact reflected both orthography and language (grammatical) usage. In the elaboration of standard orthographies, the authors were guided by the recommendations of the International Institute for African Languages and Culture which was formed in London in 1925. This later became The International African Institute. One of their pre-occupations was to elaborate workable orthographies in African languages. Because of the many sounds in African languages which did not exist in European languages, the tendency had been to utilise diacritical marks such as (, - - ^ .. : ) and many others on top, below or beside a given symbol so as to account for a given sound, e.g.: the (-) mark for the long vowel as seen earlier. For these orthographies to be workable, the Institute wanted, as much as possible, to have every sound represented by one symbol and to reduce to the minimum the use of diacritical signs or marks. Their work was somewhat simplified by what had already been done by the International Phonetic Association which was formed in Paris in 1886 and whose original name was L'Association Phonetique Internationale. This Association from its inception was made up of eminent linguists and phoneticians from various European countries such as Otto Jespensen from Denmark, Paul Passy from France (Ferender), and Henry Luncet from Britain. One of the major tasks of the Association was to identify all possible speech sounds as they exist in human languages. They then came out with the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) where an effort was made to include as many of these sound symbols as they could imagine. The symbols used are basically Roman letters with a few from Greek. The International African Institute also made its own alphabet known as the International African Alphabet (IAA) to cater for sounds in African languages. Its authors borrowed heavily from the International Phonetic Alphabet although they made some modifications. For instance, whereas in the IPA, the palatal nasal is usually written as /n/, in the International African Alphabet it is written as /ny/. It is this latter alphabet that was the basis of the standardised orthographies of Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga. Meanwhile, the Banyankore and Bakiga who had broken away from the Runyoro-Rutooro orthography conference in 1946 organised their own orthography conference in Mbarara in 1954. The conference, which was attended by prominent writers and religious leaders from Ankole and Kigezi, was chaired by Professor A. N. Tucker. A report on standardisation of Runyankore-Rukiga orthography, which was being worked out after the breakup of the Virika Conference was presented in this conference, discussed and adopted with the necessary amendments and became the basis for the language's writing system. The rules of orthography adopted, according to Taylor (1960) were published with commendable speed and enabled the translation of the Bible to proceed. They also provided the writers with a stable and consistent orthography to write their texts. It was the basis for Taylor's A Teachers' Handbook of Runyankore-Rukiga orthography of 1960.", "category": "Grammar"}

Rubongoya iii) Empandiika y'Orunyankore-Rukiga Egufuhazibwe (2005) by F. Karwemera iv) Runyoro-Rutooro Orthography (2002) by O. Ndoleriire et al. (Eds.) v) A Unified Standard Orthography of Runyakitara (2007) by O. Ndoleriire et al. While we may say that the five orthographies above are satisfactory to a certain extent, there is still need for more revisions for purposes of standardisation. The orthographical gap that still exists is mostly along dialectical differences and improper linguistic arguments. The main principle of Runyakitara orthography is that words are written the way they are pronounced or the way one hears them. The writing system adopted follows the principles of a good orthography that include accuracy. In this standardised orthography, all sounds are represented by symbols that do not leave any room for guesswork in pronunciation. The second principle followed is consistency where the same sound is represented by the same symbol with no silent letters. Convenience is the third principle that was followed. The symbols used to represent the sounds follow the alphabetic writing system. The fourth principle that was followed is conformity. The standardisation of this orthography ensured that it conforms to the orthography of other languages around the Runyakitara speaking area. The fifth principle is acceptability. Since the beginning of this writing system in 1954, it has been fully accepted by the users as required in linguistics. Following the linguistic requirements, what shall be considered as a unified standard Runyakitara orthography is as follows:", "category": "Grammar"}

The following solution was proposed: (i) The sound [n] The letters /ny/ were therefore adopted. ii) The sound /ny/ or/nj/ Examples: (b) The affricate sound/ts/ This sound is clearly pronounced in the Ruhima subdialect of Runyankore and is used where other dialects pronounce it as /s/, as shown in the following examples: Where the Bahima use /ts/, the rest of Banyankore and Bakiga use /s/ while the Banyoro and the Batooro use /k(y)/,/s/ /k(y)/,/s/ or /h(y)/ /h(y)/ as the case may be. Given the fact that those who use /ts/ in Runyakitara are a small minority, it is suggested that Runyankore-Rukiga replace /ts/ with /s/, the latter being used by the great majority of Runyankore-Rukiga speakers. (c) The copula ni− ni− This copula /ni/ - (progressive aspect before verbs) should be attached to personal pronouns and verbs but not to nouns: But: Rn/Rt Rn/Rt Note that Runyankore-Rukiga orthography usually uses niinye while RunyoroRutooro uses ninye.

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Punctuation", "completion": "Punctuation, as defined by Babcock (2002, p. 1843) is \"the act, practice, or system of inserting various standardised marks or signs in written or printed matter in order to clarify the meaning and separate structural units of a sentence\". In other words, it is the usage of spacing, conventional signs, and typographical devices that aid in the understanding and correct reading, in both silently and aloud, of written and/or printed materials. There are a number of punctuation marks that can be used in the writing of Runyakitara. They include the following: Apostrophe ['] This punctuation mark that Mubangizi (1963, p. 47) calls akahinguza in Runyakitara is used when two words are joined together especially during the process of showing possessiveness. In Runyakitara, this happens when a word that ends with vowel /a/ or /i/ is followed by a word that starts with another vowel within the same sentence. The vowel that ends the possessive is assimilated and, in its place, an apostrophe is written. For example, Yaija n'omwana [Yaija na omwana] Ry/Rk Aizire n'omwana [Aizire na omwana] Rn/Rt Egi n'enju [Egi ni enju] Ry/Rk Ogu n'omuhara [Ogu ni omuhara] (Ry/Rk) He has come with a child He has come with a child This is a house This one is his/her daughter On some occasions, an apostrophe may be used when more than two words are combined. For example, Ebyokurya n'eby'abeereere [ebyokurya ni ebya abeereere] Ry/Rk The food is for babies N'ahabw'ekyo kiina [ni ahabwa ekyo] Ry/Rk It is because of that pit The apostrophe in the above sentences represent sounds /a/ and [i] which have been assimilated. Question Mark [?] The question mark, which, according to Mubangizi (1963, p. 64), is called akabuuzo in Runyakitara, is one of the punctuation marks that is placed at the end of a sentence to indicate that it is demanding an answer or is an interrogation. It may also be used to indicate that the expression which has been made is not clear. It is mainly used when a word that is interrogative in nature appears in a sentence. For example, N'oha owaareeta ekitookye eki? [Ry/Rk] Who has brought this banana? Nookora ki? [Ry/Rk] What are you doing? N'ogu oizire nawe? [Rn/Rt] You have come also with this one? Interrogation in Runyakitara does not have specific words that determine it. This is because some words are purely interrogative while in certain times interrogation is determined by the intonation. This is strengthened by Mubangizi (1963) when he notes that interrogation can also be used when one is trying to get confirmation. In such a situation, the interrogation words do not appear but are only heard, seeking confirmation. For example, Ogu yaarya? [Ry/Rk] [Ry/Rk] Waareeta abaana? [Ry/Rk] [Ry/Rk] Waarya? [Ry/Rk] [Ry/Rk] Kiki ekikuleesire? [Rn/Rt] [Rn/Rt] Oizire di? [Rn/Rt] [Rn/Rt] Has this one eaten? Have you brought the children? Have you eaten? What has brought you? When did you come? Fullstop [.] The fullstop, which in Runyakitara is called akatoonyolakamaliriza (Mubangizi, 1963, p. 53; Caumatin 1938, p. 178), is the punctuation mark placed at the end of a sentence that is in a statement or declarative form. When placed at the end of a word in a sentence, it means that the sentence is complete. Mubangizi (1963) indicates that a fullstop happens at the end of a sentence that is declarative or advisory, or at the end of a statement of request. For example, Yaagura enyama. [Ry/Rk] He/ He/ she has bought meat. Ente baaba baziriisize. [Ry/Rk] Cows were being grazed. Orwigi yaarwigura. [Ry/Rk] He/she has opened the door. Ahikirege rwebagyo. [Rn/Rt] He arrived last evening. Turaakusangayo. [Rn/Rt] We shall find you there. Hyphen [-] This punctuation mark is called akanywanisalakateeraniza in Runyakitara (Mubangizi, 1963, p. 49; Caumatin, 1938, p. 178). It is used when words are joined to bring about a meaning that is sometimes not related to the meaning of either words. In other words, it applies when two or more words are joined together to make one meaning. It may also be used to separate syllables of a single word. In Runyakitara, it is commonly used in compound words. For example, entema-muhoro/kongora-mabeere praying mantis burugwa-izooba east rwata-migongo artillery ekifa-matu deaf person It should be noted that a hyphen is a convention that may not be penalised as an orthography mistake. This is because most compound words are regarded a single word. A hypen is also used when a word is broken at the end of the line and it is going to another line because it is long and it cannot fit or because of paper margin requirements. There is also another type of hyphen called En Dash (-) This type of dash gives a range that is not definite but just approximates. It is commonly used in estimating distances. For example, Kuruga hanu kuhikayo ni mailo eziri ahagati ya 50-60. [Ry/Rk] From here to that place its between 50-60 miles. Another type of hyphen is called Em Dash. This is used to indicate that there is more emphasis being added to the sentence. It is used in the middle of the sentence by giving the emphasis required, before the sentence gets completed. For example, Omushaija ogwo - owaatwire esente zangye akaremwa kuzishashura - takaagura ente egyo. That man - who took my money and failed to refund it - cannot buy that cow. Abantu nk'abo - abatutarukwendera kimu - tibaakwizire hanu. [Rn/Rt] People like those - whom we don't like at all - should not come here. Inverted Commas [\" \"] Inverted commas, which in Runyakitara are called obujurizo (Mubangizi, 1963, p. 63), are punctuation marks used in pairs to show a quotation or direct speech. The pair consists of an opening quotation mark placed at the beginning of a word in a superscript form and a closing quotation mark also placed at the end of the word that marks the end of a quotation. For example, Yaagira ngu, \"Jwara esaati.\" [Ry/Rk] He said, \"Put on a shirt.\" Akabagarukamu ati, \"Tindukukwetaaga\". [Rn/Rt] He replied, \"I don't need you\". It should be noted that inverted commas can be made up of one quote symbol (' ') but this depends on the emphasis the writer is giving. Brackets [( )] A bracket, which in Runyakitara is called akago (Mubangizi, 1963, p. 64; Caumatin, 1938, p. 181), is a punctuation mark that is used to match pairs within text or set apart another text. In most cases, it shows the simplified version of what the writer intended to communicate. It can appear in the middle of the sentence or at the end. For example, Naaba ngiire Buganda (Kampala). [Ry/Rk] I had gone to Buganda, (Kampala in particular). Owaareeta embuzi ni mukuru wangye (owa maarimi) orikutuura Bushenyi. [Ry/Rk] The person who brought the goat is my cousin (maternal uncle's son) who stays in Bushenyi. Brackets are sometimes used to show another word or name that means the same thing. For example, Abantu nibakunda Ruhanga (obumwe orikwetwa Omuhangi). [Ry/Rk] People love God (who is at times called The Creator). Comma [,] The comma, called akashare/akasale in Runyakitara (Mubangizi, 1963, p. 57; Caumatin, 1938, p. 178), is a punctuation mark that is used basically for separating parts of a sentence. For example, Ku baabaire nibagyenda, enjura yaagwa. Enjura egyo ekaba einemu omuyaga, orubaare hamwe n'emirabyo. [Ry/Rk] When they were going, it rained. That rain had wind, hailstones and lightning. Omu kasumi ako, enjara ekagwa nyingi. [Rn/Rt] During that time, there was a lot of famine. A comma is also used in separating words that are used in exemplifying a concept that is within the same sentence. For example, Embuzi, obume, entaama, n'ente goona n'amatungo. [Ry/Rk] Goats, rabbits, sheep and cows are all domestic animals. Bakatugurra esaati, empale, enkaito hamy n'ebitambaara. [Rn/Rt] They bought for us shirts, trousers, shoes and handkerchiefs. Exclamation Mark [!] The exclamation mark, known in Runyakitara as akatangaaro (Mubangizi, 1963, p. 55), is a punctuation mark that is in most cases used after an interjection or exclamation for the purpose of indicating a strong feeling, happiness, extreme sadness and sometimes questioning in form of a surprise. It is often placed at the end of a sentence. For example, Ai nuипи! Nyabura enanansi egi yaanura! [Ry/Rk] Alas! This pineapple is very sweet! Ruhanga wange! Obaire ki? [Rn/Rt] Oh my God! What has happened to you? Colon [:] The colon, which in Runyakitara is called akategyerezo/akategerezo (Mubangizi, 1963, p. 47; Caumatin, 1938, p. 181), is a punctuation mark that is used to explain or start an enumeration. For example, Uganda eine yunivasite za Gavumenti itaano: Makerere, Mbarara, Gulu, Busitema na Muni. [Ry/Rk] Uganda has five Government universities, namely: Makerere, Mbarara, Gulu, Busitema and Muni. Buli kiro osome esaara zinu: Isiitwe ali mw'iguru, Mirembe Maria n'Ekitii nisa kibe hali Isiitwe. [Rn/Rt] Everyday say the following prayers: Our Father, Hail Mary and Glory be to the Father. A colon is also used with ratios in mathematics, For example, Abaishiki nibakira aboojo n'omubaro gwa 5:3. Girls outnumber the boys to a ratio of 5:3. A colon can also be used in titles and subtitles of books. For example, Mubangizi, B. (1981). Kanyarurimi II. Mbarara: Omuhanda gw'Okumanya. A colon is further used in indicating hours and minutes, for example, Omukoro niguza kubaho shaaha 11:15 z'omwabazyo. The function will take place at 5:15pm 5:15pm. Examples: Semi (colon [;]).", "category": "Grammar"}

Runyakitara has only five short vowels, namely: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/. Runyakitara also has five long vowels which are represented by writing the vowel twice. These are: /aa/, /ee/, /ii/, /oo/ and /uu/. All short vowels shall be written with one letter while all long vowel shall be doubled to represent a single sound. At any time, if the vowel length is predicted, a single vowel shall be written. No double vowel shall be written at the beginning of the word even when the vowel is pronounced long. For example, Ego though heard to be long, shall not be written as eego. All Runyakitara words shall not have a double vowel at the end of the word. There are situations when two different vowels combine in words. These are called diphthongs. The rule shall be that speakers write the way they pronounce those diphthongs. The most common diphthongs are the following: /ai/, /ei/, /oi/. Examples are found in words like amaizi (water), amaino (teeth), eicumu (spear), kubeiha (to lie), kuboigora (to bark). The diphthong /au/ exists in rare cases such as in a word mau (mother) in Runyoro-Rutooro. The writing system of Runyakitara shall use simple alphabetic letters. This enables the orthography to avoid complicated phonetic symbols such as. β,ȷˉ β, ˉ ​ and diacritic signs e.g. ∼∼ ∼∼ . Runyakitara shall use the following consonants: / l/ shall be used in Runyoro-Rutooro only and before ya, ye and yo as in okulya (to eat), omulyango (doorway), okulyeryesa (to entice), lyona (all) and before e or i in examples such as okuleeta (to bring) and okulinda (to keep).

{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Introduction", "completion": "In this chapter, we analyse and describe different kinds of written texts, mainly stories in Runyakitara. This description entails examining how these stories are constructed, interpreted and used and the defining characteristics that written Runyakitara texts exhibit. In addition, the chapter explores the lexico-grammatical (lexical and grammatical) properties that define Runyakitara texts and their organisational features. In other words, it explains the kind of linguistic resources/tools that writers of Runyakitara use to write these texts, that is, the words and the grammar that go into a text, and how the text is organised. These will not only enable you to understand deeper a Runyakitara text but also will equip you with appropriate skills that will enable you to eventually write effective Runyakitara texts in an acceptable and conventional manner. By the end of the chapter, you should be able to describe different written text types in Runyakitara; define the features that characterise these texts; and in due course write similar Runyakitara texts. Admittedly, there are many types of written texts in Runyakitara; and we cannot exhaustively explain each one of them in this chapter. Therefore, we confine ourselves to examining narratives. However, we provide examples of other texts to illustrate the criteria and steps that are observed in the analysis of texts in general. In the narratives, we analyse traditional stories and contemporary stories (news stories). In order to understand Runyakitara written texts, you will be introduced to an analytical approach which will assist you to analyse a variety of other Runyakitara texts. This analytical approach is known as genre analysis. This approach is derived from a popular theory known as genre theory. It is a simple method that you can use to analyse a group of texts that share similar linguistic characteristics. The genre analysis also enables you to examine other texts that will not have been explored in this chapter. The analysis will further illustrate how the elements you have studied in the previous chapters (adverbs, adjectives, semantics and Runyakitara lexis) are manifest in these written texts. Note that genre analysis is one of the many methods used to analyse texts, and one of the analytical approaches employed in the analysis of linguistic discourses. The chapter begins by providing a brief definition of discourse analysis. It then defines the various methods used to analyse linguistic texts. This is followed by an overview of the concept of genre since it is important to study genres. The chapter then delves into genre analysis by detailing the characteristics that enable one to identify a genre and the procedure followed in analysing genres. We then examine narrative genres in general and zero down on the properties and generic structure of Runyakitara traditional stories; and finally, we examine the contemporary news story. Since this is one of the first discourse analyses of Runyakitara texts, we rely heavily on studies that have been carried out on other languages, particularly English. It is, however, anticipated that, in due course, further research in discourse analysis in Runyakitara and other Ugandan Bantu languages will avail more technical terms and examples for future use. We will now briefly look at discourse analysis before we explain the details of genre analysis. What is Discourse Analysis? Before we define 'discourse analysis', it is necessary to understand the term 'discourse'. This term is usually used in different academic contexts by different people to refer to specific meanings. 'Discourse' can refer to the sequence of sentences, how \"sentences connect and relate to each other across time in speech or writing\" (Gee, 2014, p. 18). In this case, the analysis focuses on the structure and organisation of sentences. It can also be understood as \"a particular way of talking about and understanding the world\" (Jørgensen & Phillips, 2002, p. 1). Another meaning of discourse is language in use; it is concerned with how people use language in different specific contexts, which at times, is referred to as 'pragmatics'. Discourse analysis has been defined as the analysis of written and spoken language beyond the sentence level. Some scholars have defined it as \"the analysis of linguistic behaviour, written and spoken, beyond the limits of individual sentences, focusing primarily on the meaning constructed and interpreted as language is used in particular social contexts\" (Bhatia, Flowerdew, & Jones, 2008, p. 1). It is also understood as \"the study of the relationship between language and the contexts in which it is used\" and involves analysing different written texts as well as verbal communication in various forms (McCarthy, 2001, p. 5). Recently, discourse analysis has embraced other forms of communication including visual images, sounds, icons, etc. which we shall briefly explain below. Discourse analysis therefore, involves the analysis of lin-", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Methods used in Discourse Analysis", "completion": "Discourse analysis makes use of various analytical approaches using different types of materials to achieve a wide range of goals (Bhatia et al., 2008). Discourse analysis cuts across different fields of study which use different discourse analytical methods to analyse written and spoken texts. Some of these include conversational analysis (CA), critical discourse analysis (CDA), corpus-based discourse analysis, mediated discourse analysis, multimodal discourse analysis, and genre analysis. Let's briefly look at each of these approaches. Corpus-based discourse analysis involves the use of big amounts of texts which can be read by different types of technologies. The method avails information about the patterns of language as far as grammar and vocabulary are concerned; the analysis is applied to large texts rather than sentences or short texts. In English language, for example, the analysis has revealed that the word 'glass' \"occurs with ... a set of words related to drinks: \"lemonade, water, milk\" while 'cause' occurs with such negative words as \"accident, damage, death or trouble\" (Bhatia et al., 2008, pp. 7-8). Critical discourse analysis (CDA) is concerned with the use of language in society in relation to social injustice, inequality, unfairness, power abuse and ideological imposition, etc. (Fairclough, 1995; Richardson, 2007). Fairclough (2001) has described CDA as an approach that is concerned with how language is linked to the social elements such as exploitation and domination of people by other people. It is mainly concerned with power and its control. It aims to find out how ideologies become entrenched in language and how they can be freed; it helps society to be aware of social injustices as well as trying to establish the communicator's purpose and attitude in constructing communication. The context of communication within which the communication takes place is central to CDA. Conversational analysis refers to how members of a society interact and interpret their experiences. The analysis involves looking at the procedures and rules that govern conversations. The analysts study those interactions that unfold in natural contexts which have been transcribed. Another recent analytical approach is known as multimodal discourse analysis. Note that the examples we have given above use written or spoken texts as their primary resources for analysis. Multimodal discourse analysis however, is concerned with the analysis of other forms of social interaction. These include gestures, posture, images, graphic representations, text layout, music, icons, etc. Most analyses using the multimodal approach have focused on TV images, and newspaper and film pictures. Another approach is genre analysis which will form the basis of this chapter. Genre analysis derives from the study of English in academic environments. It is concerned with examining linguistic behaviour in academic or professional contexts (Bhatia et al., 2008). The above approaches have been largely applied to texts and other resources in English and other European languages as well as Asian languages. However, very little has been done to apply, for example, genre analysis to African languages. The purpose of this chapter therefore, is to apply this particular discourse analytical approach to written Runyakitara texts. Since no discourse analytical approach has been explored in Runyakitara, we shall base our analysis on the principles that have been used to analyse mainly English texts. What is genre? In everyday life, you encounter several communication contexts in both written and spoken forms. These range from emails, conversations with friends or relatives, informal and formal letters, telephone exchanges, text messages to newspaper or magazine articles, novels, textbook readings, advertisements, noticeboard announcements, etc. These different texts possess individual characteristics that differentiate them from other texts. These differences are known as linguistic features that define each text (Eggins & Slade, 1997). For example, a telephone exchange cannot begin with the following utterance: (1) Ahari Ateenyi wange omugonzibwa типо, Similarly, a story cannot end with the following proposition: (2) Nyowe, Yohaana Rutamirike naaguza Petero Kayonjo ekibanja kyangye kirikwingana hiika ibiri. These two examples (1 and 2), though culled from their actual communicative contexts, demonstrate linguistic differences that characterise and define specific texts in Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga, respectively. These linguistic differences are very important in the analysis of different texts in Runyakitara. The linguistic differences vary from lexical elements, grammatical elements, style used to how a given text is organised from its beginning to the end. The concept of genre therefore, is defined on the basis of the similarity or distinctive features a text has. It has been defined as a group of texts that demonstrate specific similar linguistic and functional properties (Lee, 2001). For example, sports articles or obituaries that appear in newspapers possess specific linguistic features that distinguish them from editorials or advertisements. Similarly, recipes, novels, and news articles can be identified because of their distinctive features. In simple terms, genre can be defined as a group of texts that exhibit similar linguistic properties. However, the term 'genre' has different meanings and is interpreted in varied ways by different scholars within their individual fields of study. Therefore, the definition of genre is rather abstract and problematic to understand and as you progress in your linguistic studies, you will encounter other explanations of genre, which we have not explored in this chapter. Because this concept has, over time, traversed other disciplines gaining deep ground in linguistics, discourse analysis, academic and professional English, and first and second language (L1 and L2) learning and teaching. For example, in literary studies, 'genre' has been traditionally associated with such literary genres as sonnet, epic, epitaph, tales, legends, novels, or proverbs, which are identified in terms of structure, subject matter, language use, and how they are produced (Kress, 1993; Freedman & Medway, 1994). We shall, later on, discover that some of the literary genres attributes of form and content have persisted in genre as a discourse/linguistic term. Other scholars such as Martin (2009) and Martin and Rose (2003, pp. 7-8) define it as \"a staged, goal-oriented social process. Social because we participate in genres with other people; goal-oriented because we use genres to get things done; staged because it usually takes us a few steps to reach our goals\". The stages or moves are the steps or phases that a genre writer goes through. Therefore, while analysing genres, we pay attention to how a text develops in specific unique steps. Other scholars have explained genre in terms of the cultural and social contexts where people use genre to describe the different ways in which they use language to accomplish things repeatedly, and in the process validating more genres that are a result of new societal requirements and abandoning those that are not useful. They argue that genres fulfil the social function within various cultural communities, for example, whenever people meet on a regular basis to carry out certain activities, these activities become standardised. Genres are realised via the means of language. Therefore, genre as a social process arises out of people meeting on a regular basis and using language (Kress, 1993; Martin, 2009). We are always engaged in genres on a daily basis and these genres include buying or selling items, seeking and giving information, telling a story, gossiping, making an appointment, exchanging opinion, conversing with a friend (Eggins, 1994), etc. Why is it Important to Acquire Genre Knowledge? Analysing discourse is significant because it explains what language is used for. It helps to understand how language is used in different settings such as academic, workplace and professional settings. Genres are the media through which scholars and scientists communicate with each other. The study of genre therefore, is critical for many scholars, researchers, and professionals including linguists, political scientists, philosophers, anthropological, sociologists, business people, and communication experts. Therefore, to participate or understand the scholarly and scientific discourse, they need to be aware of the underlying functions and features that genres in such fields possess. For example, it is necessary to possess sound knowledge of genres used in law, academics, and journalism in order to produce such genres as contracts, research articles, and features, respectively. To this end, genre study is instrumental and aims to help a writer accomplish writing tasks in an acceptable manner once s/he has understood how genres work as well as telling whether the texts produced are wrong or right and if they conform to acceptable standards of a given profession (Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Bazerman, 2004). Genre knowledge also enables us to understand the customs, knowledge, and beliefs of genre users, which are inherent in their cultures, and the daily activities they are involved in. For example, the study of the narrative genre (ebigano, emigani, enganikyo) in Runyakitara reveals the beliefs, behaviours, food and ways of living of Bakiga, Banyankore, Batooro and Banyoro. The analysis of texts is also important because it enables us to learn about texts that were not acquired within the home or community environment. These texts possess \"linguistic structures and patterns\" that \"students must learn... to recognise and interpret\" (Biber & Conrad, 2009, p. 3) and later on be able to produce. It is not necessary for you to learn how to greet or talk to your mother or brother, or even write a text message on a mobile phone to a friend today. However, it is important to learn how to write an application letter, or how to write an examination paper. In this regard, as Biber and Conrad (2009) argue that there is need to teach genres to university students in order to succeed, it is equally important to explore the hitherto unknown construction and linguistic features of Runyakitara texts given the significance of the language in academic and socio-political contexts. A similar significance to the above relates to genre-based language teaching and learning, which has been the major field of language teaching and learning in Australia, America and recently in South Africa. The genrebased pedagogy is concerned with the textual structures and linguistic resources that characterise quality writing of various genres in the school system (Visser, 2013). Genre-based pedagogy enables both teachers and learners of African languages, particularly those from underprivileged communities, to handle written and spoken tasks required at secondary school and tertiary levels of education. Visser (2013, p. 5) further argues that it also \"equips language teachers of African languages to facilitate the literacy development of learners in their respective first languages[s]\". In fact, genre-based teaching and learning enables learners to acquire text-linguistic competencies that would lead them to produce quality academic written texts (Visser, 2013; Hyland, 2002, 2003). The knowledge of genre will help you understand educational genres including lectures, tutorials, reports, essays, seminars and workshops, examinations, textbooks, etc. The teaching of genre enables students to master these genres thus gaining empowerment at school, later on at the workplace and be able to participate in various ways of social life (Cope & Kalantzis, 1993; Gillearts & Shaw, 2006).", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Genre Analysis", "completion": "Genre analysis is an approach used to examine linguistic behaviour as it is manifested in academic or professional settings (Bhatia, 2004). The choice for genre analysis relates to the inadequacy of the previous discourse approaches to address pedagogical needs, explain textual analysis, and categorise texts based on their similarities and differences (Hopkins & Dudley, 1988). Swales (1990) has equally argued that traditional analysis of texts did not offer reasons to explain why 'genre texts' appear the way they do. Genre analysis therefore, is a result of the inadequacy of previous approaches (register analysis, grammatical-rhetorical analysis, and interactional analysis) to provide sufficient information for deep structure analysis or explain the reasons why certain texts appear the way they do. Bhatia argues that genre analysis (applied genre analysis) combines the socio-cultural, institutional and organisational explanations for English for Specific Purposes and applied linguistics in general. This is \"a thicker description\" of both lexico-grammatical properties and organisational features, which borrows from several disciplines in order to arrive at a deeper and insightful analytical description of texts and explanation of language use in professional and academic genres (Bhatia, 1993, p. 5-10, 2004, 2008). Genre analysis is significant because it allows one to \"understand how members of specific discourse communities construct, interpret and use genres in order to accomplish a communicative purpose and why they write them the way they do\" (Bhatia, 2004, p. 10). It also facilitates the comprehension of the \"the social and cultural contexts in which genres are located\" and understanding how such factors relate to the \"language choices\" that users make (Paltridge, 2002). The analysis of genres requires acquisition of linguistic competencies related to syntax (grammar), lexicon (vocabulary), and the organisational structure of a given genre. The knowledge of genre responds to such writing needs and skills as description, explanation, argumentation, persuasion, entertainment, instruction, responding, or recording events. These skills are not only crucial to accomplish academic tasks in the education system but also significant to one's life at the place of work. For this reason, \"genre teaching should emancipate students by giving them the possibility to live up to the expectations of the professional world\" (Gillearts & Shaw, 2006, p. 8).", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Identification of Genres", "completion": "Genres possess easily recognised characteristics that when we come across them, we know what kind of genre a given text is. These properties lead us to identify what kind of message to expect in the text. In a simple example of the lost and found texts in a newspaper, we expect to find the identification of the person who lost the item, the description of the lost item, contact details, and perhaps a reward for whoever finds the item. Alternatively, if an examination paper and a letter are placed before us, we are able to distinguish one from the other because of the uniqueness that each one of them possesses. The words and grammar, the interlocutors (writers and speakers), the steps/stages the interactants go through, the purpose of interaction, the medium of interaction (spoken or written), etc. help us to recognise what genre the text in question is about. The knowledge of the culture within which a genre is located is equally important for us to identify a genre because different cultures use language differently. For example, the exchange in Example 3 below reveals a lot (Ry/Rk): (3) S1: Okabura! S2: Naiwe waabuzire. S1: Ndamutsya tureebe. S2: Buhooro, buhooro, buhooro gye. S1: Hmmm, hmmm, mmmm. S2: Muraara muta? S1: Turiyo... The exchange tells about an encounter between two adults who have not seen each other for a long period (demonstrated in the greeting using propositions like okabura and buhooro). It is a face-to-face encounter involving two people of unequal social status or different ages. The begging of ndamutsya tells us that this interlocutor cannot initiate a greeting; he/she begs the other person to greet first. Among the Banyankore-Bakiga, a young person is not supposed to initiate greeting an elder, especially when they have not seen each other for a long time. Similarly, certain social ties demand that a person of higher social status (father-in-law, an uncle, and mother-in-law) initiates the greeting, no matter the age. In accomplishing a given task using language, social conventions require that we do so systematically. These steps or stages are known as the schematic structures of a genre (Eggins & Slade, 1997). A genre is composed of stages/steps which are regarded as its constituent parts or constituent structure. The stages enable us to communicate effectively since we cannot make meaning at a go. These stages are related to each other in order to fulfil the function of the text and achieve the overall communicative goal of the genre. In other words, the stage fulfils a given function in a genre. Note that in some of the genres, these steps/stages are optional while in others they are obligatory. Although these elements can be left out, the text remains the same; in other words, the genre does not change. It should also be noted that some of these elements are recursive, that is, they appear more than once in a genre. The stages in the written genres usually occur as separate paragraphs. The stage is normally recognised by similar grammatical and lexical properties. The steps can be clearly identified because of their peculiarity. For example, in English, the phrase 'once upon a time' is associated with a narrative genre while 'Nyowe Kanyamunyu naaguza ekibanja kyangye...' in Runyankore-Rukiga is typical to a transactional genre of a legal nature. In recipe and instructional manual genres, there is the use of imperatives in the Method stage while the Ingredients Stage is characterised by numbers or measuring words. In a business letter, the Complimentary Close stage is conveyed via polite expressions. The use of temporal conjunctions such as 'and', 'then', 'after', 'before', and temporal circumstances such as 'until the age of', 'at that time', 'at the mission', 'in the early 1970s', 'in those years', 'during the 1980s', etc. reveals different stages in an English narrative genre (Martin & Rose, 2008). Genres are recognised because of 'repeated textual patterns' or 'easy to notice features' (Bazerman, 2004, p. 322). For example, stories usually begin with the following phrase: \"once upon a time\", while business letters are characterised by inside addresses. A close examination of traditional stories in Runyakitara reveals the following beginnings: Hakaba hariho omushaija ... or Obundi.... However, not all Runyakitara narratives begin in a similar manner. Language plays a central role in analysing genres, after all, genres are realised through language. In this regard, genre can also be identified based on typical patterns in a text; for example, the grammatical items or the graphical elements used. Different genres possess different words and grammatical structures. Even within a genre, the words and structures used across stages will differ. In an application letter, the words and grammatical choices in a Complimentary Close differ from those in an introductory stage. These grammatical patterns enable us to demarcate the stage boundaries and identify the number of stages of a genre (see Text 1). The stages are given genre-specific labels rather than the traditional designation such as beginning, middle, end or even Introduction, Body and Conclusion (Eggins, 1994; Bhatia, 2004).

Although genres are relatively stable texts because they arise from stable discourse communities whose discursive practices are stable for a given period, they never remain so (Myers, 2000). Once the communicative needs change, so do the genres (Ramanathan & Kaplan, 2000). Genres are dynamic because they are embedded in cultural practices and these are never stable (Muntigl & Gruber, 2005). Speakers/writers often stray away from the standard form; others produce the socially recognised types while others create complicated ones. Several other studies regarding genre change have been carried out particularly on the changes that scientific research articles have undergone since they appeared on the academic scene (Swales, 1990; Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Bhatia, 1993; Ayers, 2008). Other genre changes have been observed in other fields. For example, the use of Power Point presentations that were designed for business-related purposes, have been adopted by academics (Myers, 2000). Another genre change study shows how an electronic mail has created a 'new sub-genre' of letter writing which excludes the recipient's address and date, the latter being generated automatically (Ramanathan & Kaplan, 2000). Gillaerts and Shaw (2006) also observe that the letter genre has been overtaken by email and fax pushing the former to the periphery. In this regard, we shall also point out how some of texts in Runyakitara are undergoing changes, for example, the news report. Another significant aspect in the study of genre is genre mixing. Genre mixing involves the inclusion of some other elements in a specific genre, for example, the intrusion of advertising features in news editorials and company reports (Hyland, 2002; Bhatia, 2004). Another observed form of genre mixing occurs in academic in- troductions such as preface, foreword and acknowledgment. Although their communicative purpose is to introduce, other hidden promotional purposes are exhibited (Bhatia, 1997; 2004), they use descriptive adjectives and linguistic features that are common in advertising genres. In this regard, we discover genre mixing whereby the genres of textbook introductions possess two communicative goals, that is, to introduce and to promote the book. Genre mixing has also been identified in job advertisements. The construction of job adverts contains persuasive elements which are intended to appeal to the post-modern job advert as well as the traditional formal conventions of a job advert genre (Norlyk, 2006). Because of the consumerism culture in our societies today, documents of most companies and organisations comprise promotional elements (Bhatia, 2000). Another basis for genre identification is 'variation'. This involves analysing many texts to determine how similar or different the texts are. For example, sales agreements would vary between those of land and those of other properties like cars. The variations usually occur across disciplines. The textbook genre cuts across such disciplines as Mathematics, History, Science, Law or Economics. However, a textbook in each of these will exhibit unique discipline-based features. Science textbooks will use diagrams, pictures and tables while knowledge presentation in literature textbooks is likely not to contain such visual materials. While Law and Economics texts will refer to other scholars, it is not the case in Mathematics texts (Bhatia, 2004).", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Analysing Genres", "completion": "In analysing unfamiliar genres, Bhatia (1993,2004) (1993,2004) recommends that one should first consider his/her experience and knowledge about the field in which the genre-text belongs. If you do not possess this knowledge, then you examine the existing literature on that genre in order to learn more about it. Secondly, you consider the situational context which enables you to define who the speaker or writer of the text is and the target audience. It also reveals the history, sociocultural beliefs of the community in which the text is used. It is also important to identify which other texts are similar or related to the text in order to provide the background. If the genre you are analysing falls within a specific institution, there is need to study the institutional context, such as the rules and conventions that govern the writing of texts. For example, the analysis of sale agreements requires knowledge of rules and language that lawyers use to construct these agreements while writing the genre of a business order requires good knowledge of business communication. This stage is followed by linguistic analysis. Linguistic analysis involves the analysis of text patterns which reveal linguistic use of the members of the community that use that genre. The analysis entails looking at the lexico-grammar; i.e., both the vocabulary and grammatical elements of the text. The text patterns revealed by this analysis will provide answers to why things are done the way they are done. For example, the presence of adjectives in advertisements is intended to facilitate positive description of the product. Structural analysis is also significant in analysing genres. It provides different ways of how language is organised while communicating a specific message. Because of the regularity of a genre, genre writers usually follow a regular systematic way in communicating the general message in a specific genre. Structural analysis therefore, is concerned with the consistent and preferred ways known as moves/stages/steps. As noted above, each move has a specific communicative purpose it fulfils via different linguistic or rhetorical techniques available to the writer (Bhatia, 1993). Examining the linguistic and organizational features across a collection of similar texts reveals similarities and differences as well as consistencies or inconsistencies of a given genre (Bazerman, 2004). Although it is quite challenging, it is advisable that at the end of the process, the genre analyst should seek expert knowledge from members of a community that are involved in the production of those texts or the institution that produces that genre s/he is analysing for cross-checking the findings and clarifying some issues (Bhatia, 1993). This is also done because certain professions, e.g., law or journalism, prescribe what should or should not go into a text and how this text is supposed to be used or interpreted. The specialists can identify the kinds of texts they work with and provide expert interpretation of how they are created and used. They can also provide reasons and factors attributed to deviations (variations) in a given genre. Lastly, genre identification can also be carried out through ethnographic research, which involves interacting with people at their workplace and regularly collecting and studying the texts they produce. In this way, the researcher observes the reasons for using the texts, how they are written, used and interpreted. In the next section, we apply genre theoretical principles examined above to three different genre texts in Runyakitara. First, we shall begin by reviewing the genre analysis of English narratives and relate it to Runyakitara narratives. Next, we analyse a contemporary news story and argumentative writing in the print media; and finally, we shall apply genre analysis to semi-legal writing in Runyakitara by examining a will and a sale agreement.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Narrative Genres", "completion": "Stories are significant in our lives; they \"are central genres in all cultures.... They are told in all social groupings to interpret life's chaos and rhythms, to evaluate each other's behaviour, and to educate and entertain our children\" (Rose & Martin, 2008, p. 49). Martin and Rose further argue that the stories' power to grip the attention of both children and adults is inexplicable. They exist across different domains of life, for example, movies, novels, short stories, news stories, plays, etc. (Macken-Horarik, 2002), and they have been comprehensively studied (Martin & Rose, 2008). You will have learnt that in English language, narrative writing mainly serves to tell in detail a story that has one main point. The narration process requires looking at and examining events in a chronological order. It tells what has happened in a story. The composition follows a chronological ordering (start at the beginning and go on until you come to the end, and then you stop). For example, a story about a memorable ride on a bodaboda [motorcycle] would perhaps begin by telling the reader/listener the place where the motorcycle was located. It would then go on to indicate price negotiation and the time when it was taken, the exciting events along the itinerary, the most exciting event, which would mark the peak of the ride - the best moment, and finally the destination. The climax could however, entail a crisis point, for example, an accident, fuel shortage, a brush with a traffic officer, or hijacking the protagonist. In this regard, the narrative would then go on into another phase of recounting how this problem is resolved. In such a story, a chronological order of how events unfold is observed. However, the order can be subverted depending on the narrator's choice. The narrator can choose to plunge into the middle of the story with a startling, amusing, or dramatic event so as to grab the reader's attention. The typical examples of narrative writing include novels and short stories, biographies and autobiographies, diary, some newspaper articles, radio and TV news reports, conversational anecdotes, etc. Besides narrative genres, other story genres also trace a series of events of personal recounts. They are categorised into four text types: recounts, anecdotes, exemplums, and observations (Martin & Rose, 2008). In brief, recounts entail narrating events in a sequence having no significant problem while anecdotes recount humourous events that are out of the ordinary. The adventures of Ishe-Katabaazi provide good examples of anecdote stories. Exemplums recount events which entail moral assessment. Observations recount events in which the narrator provides a negative or positive judgement. Note that the narrative differs from the others in that it exhibits a disrupting event (complication), which is then resolved and the story returns to the hitherto social stability. The story genre has been found to exhibit the following generic staging: Abstract, Orientation, Complication, Evaluation, Resolution and Coda (Macken-Horarik, 2002; van Leeweun, 2008; Martin and Rose, 2008). The Abstract comprises the topic of the story and is intended to attract the attention of the listener/reader; it tells the listeners/readers what the story is about. The Orientation stage entails the setting, that is, the people (characters) who are involved, the place and time of the story. It also provides the first incident of the story. The Complication involves the main event of the narrative, a problem. This is usually a destabilisation of social harmony, which could be a family order or a hunting expedition order. In fact, the narrative genre aims to resolve a problem. In an extended narrative (macro genre), there might exist several complications and resolutions. The Evaluation stage comprises the significance and relevance of the event(s) for the character(s). The Resolution, which is usually the last event, provides the solution to the problem. It attempts to restore the hitherto existing social harmony. The Coda is a stage in which the storyteller/writer signs off. It serves to bring back events to normalcy, that is, the status quo of events before the complication set in. It acts as a bridge between the story world and the moment of the narration. Both the Abstract and Coda are optional while Evaluation can occur several times during the progression of the story. In the next section, we apply these stages to establish whether they equally apply across Runyakitara stories.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: Runyakitara Story Genres", "completion": "Martin and Rose (2008) have shown how the different types of stories are realised in both oral and written mediums. Stories have existed in the pre-modern and contemporary cultural contexts throughout the world. In this regard therefore, Runyakitara stories known as emigani, ebigano, or enganikyo have been recounted in South-Western Uganda and beyond, from one generation to the next via oral tradition usually at a fireplace after the evening meal. This oral tradition has, of course, bred dissimilarities in the content. Most of the stories are lost because they were not captured in writing. Runyakitara comprises both short and long stories as well as novels. The short stories usually comprise fables that are narrated to young children while the extended ones take a while to narrate and are enchanting to both children and adults. Because of the limitations of space, we shall analyse two short stories for their generic properties. The first is a short story extracted from a Runyankore Reader for lower level primary learners.

(Source: van Spaandonk (1997), Ninshoma, p. 46). In this story, the narrator begins by presenting the characters of the story, i.e., Ente and Warucuncu. Since this is a fable, the exact place where the characters lived is not revealed, it is assumed to be the in the wilderness. However, leaving out the place provides the narrator with an opportunity to localise the story because stories are told within a certain locality. It is therefore assumed that both characters lived in the wilderness adjacent to where the reader/listener lives. Although, the time element is embedded in the verbal proposition, egyenda ezingura, which portrays the near past tense, it is categorized as the narrative tense, which is often used in storytelling, and it conveys the far past tense. While in most cases, either the tense is conveyed in varying forms of the past tense, as nearpast far-past tense, or even using words such as nyomwabazyo, it does not mean that the actions occurred in the recent past. Therefore, our Orientation stage fulfils the function of designating the setting of the story by introducing the characters, place and time elements. It also presents that harmonious existence between the protagonists, ezingura na Warucuncu. Nyomwabzyo ... The Complication stage presents the problem that has to be resolved. The problem is eifa Kamirakwo, which leads to the killing of the calf and the subsequent revenge from the cow: Warucuncu eita encwamutwe yaayo. Ente ku eija ehoora enzigu, eita ekibwana kyakyo. Note that this particular Complication comprises two problems, one leading to the other. The famine disrupts the social order, and in turn it provokes a conflict between the protagonists. In the Resolution stage, the cow seeks refuge at the Hare's place, Eirukanga, esingirwa owa Wakame omu nyanga and the Hare protects the cow from an impending vengeance by repulsing the Lion, Ekicuncu ku kiija, Wakame akibingira omu irembo. The interpretation of the ever-close relationship between the Hare and cows is then provided in the Evaluation stage. In other fables, the story ends with a moral lesson for human beings, often intended for the reader to relate himself/herself to a similar unjust situation and conveyed via a proverb. For example, in a story of migratory locusts and bald locusts/non-migratory locusts (Ekiharara n'Enzigye), we discover that the locusts learnt that they could not move along with migratory locusts, thus, Akarugire amahanga tikeesigwa. Or in the story of Engwe n'embwa, the story ends in an Evaluation stage with a proverb, Owaakukiza emikono akurasha oine obwawe, portraying the powerlessness of the dog in the face of a dominant and ferocious leopard.", "category": "Grammar"}

We also note that process actions marked by the narrative tense: egyenda, ezingura, eba egiire, eita, eija ehoora, esingirwa. Even at this lower level, we also note the use of non-core vocabulary, emiguutuuro, for example, ezingura, eifa Kamirakwo, esingirwa, and omu nyanga instead of etuura, enjara y'amaani, ehungira, and omu ibaare respectively. This demonstrates the significance Runyakitara narrative attaches to the inculcation of intricate linguistic features but also culture via stories at an early stage. Note that although nyomwabazyo is a time adjunct, it does not mean that this event happened yesterday; it situates the event in the far past. Another element in this phrase, hataaha eifa shows that the event took place a long time ago because eifa has not been experienced in modern times.

(Source: Mubangizi, B. K. (1989). Nkutebeze 4. Mbarara: Omuhanda gw'Okumanya). In this story, the orientation stage begins with identification of the main participants, omushaija n'omutabani; the main activity of the narrative, kuhiga; and the place, eihamba, omu bwerere. Other narratives in Runyakitara bear almost similar lexico-grammatical features to the present one. In many of the stories, we come across the following constructions signaling the Orientation stage in Runyoro-Rutooro: Oти biro bya ira muno, hakaimuka omusaija ...; Ira muno hakaba haroho ...; or Hakaba hariho omushaija...; Omushaija akashwera omukazi, baazaara...; Omushaija akaba...; or ...akaimuka... in Runyankore-Rukiga. Note that most of these entail a male participant, revealing the patriarchal nature of the Banyakitara society. There are indeed other beginnings that include a female participant. The Complication sets in immediately, Ku baabaire nibagihuumuza bati, zaareeta bwahara bw'entare. The reader knows what the immediate arrival of a lion means [the danger] to the man and his son. The Complication stage is always marked by ku ku to show an abrupt disruption of the social order. The following extracts signal the commencement of a complication in their respective stories: (4) Abaishiki b'ekyaro kimwe bakaimuka aho, baaza kwiha obunyaatsi. Ku baabaire nibaiha, enjura yaacurumbukana kugwa. ... Ku baza kushohora, Waruhiri eguruka eyeroteka aha muryango, eti \"Omuriimwe ninyendamu owangye.\" Ngu \"Reero ka mwije mureebe obuhano!\" (Nkuganire 1, p. 54) (5) ... Ku ecumitamu omunwa gagitaaha omu maisho. Eronda ogw'okutooramu, gubura (Ninshoma, p. 48). This is followed by Evaluation stage; the storyteller then goes on to describe the appearance of the lion and the imminent danger it poses. We note that the evaluation stages in this story are conveyed via metaphors that exhibit the richness of the language. In this segment, the storyteller employs similes ... amaisho nigagitukura oti barasiiremu eshagama, akanwa nikagingana oruteba ruteeka amaizi g'obushera, enyindo ziri emigyeto nk'emambo zibamba emiguta, to describe the physical attributes of the King of the jungle that portray its ferociousness. In the second evaluation stage, we also note a similar rhetorical technique to show the danger the toad poses before the lion: engundu y'ekikyere..., amaisho gakigurukire, amatama nikihaga nikihaguurura nk'orikucumika enyungu ebuzire etaabe. In this regard, the evaluation stage demonstrates the narrator's attitudes vis-à-vis an event being narrated or a participant appearing in the story. It makes the story worth listening to/reading by employing such linguistic resources of exaggeration or evaluating events that hold the attention of the reader/listener. Although, at first sight, the Resolution appears as a problem (perhaps to a child listening/reading for the first time), it embeds a solution because common knowledge tells us that a toad cannot 'swallow' a lion. Of course, the raconteur reveals the resolution by portraying the foolhardiness of a lion, which is threatened by the physical appearance of the toad. Whereas the lion is mighty, its understanding is lowered and portrayed as lacking astuteness. On the other hand, despite the toad's weakness, it is portrayed as a wise participant whose utterances resolve the problem. Runyakitara tales also exhibit a unique rhetorical technique, ekitongyerero or ekizina (Example 6), which is non-existent in the two stories we have examined. This feature consists in one of the participants singing a song or performing a recitation in the Resolution stage. The song or recitation acts to resolve or points to the resolution of a problem. It appears to possess magical powers that resolve the problem. The song in itself carries an entertainment function. As children, we would prefer our mother or grandmother to tell us a story that has a song in it. (6) Ku aba naatongyerera atyo, Njuma omu muti amuhurira, nawe amugarukamu naatongyerera. Ati \"Ya Njunju, ya Njunju, yaiwe mutetsi, Onywe ago mate, orekye kwitwa obutetsi; Otuze ezo nyena, orekye kwitwa obutetsi; Oihe ekyarire, orekye kwitwa obutetsi; Ocwe n'enkoni, orekye kwitwa obutetsi; Ogyende ogambire, taata, yaiwe mutetsi, Njunzire eitama rimweija, n'orubaju rumwe. Mbaire ntungirwe amaizi g'omu bitsigye, Mbwenu goomire, buzima naaza kukaba.\" (Nkuganire 1, p. 69) (Runyankore-Rukiga). The Coda returns the story to the equilibrium, that is, what would have happened, under normal circumstances, if the problem had not set in. It signs off the story and returns to life's equilibrium. In most Runyakitara narratives, it is marked by temporal conjunction, Ku ntsiga... It is only at this stage that we observe the narrator, for the first time, directly referring to him/herself, telling us that he/she was an eyewitness to the events of story. However, in the oral tradition, this direct reference to the narrator occurs at the very beginning (in the abstract) of the story, thus: Mbaganire mbaganire. The Coda is a bridge between the last event of the story and the present time of narration. It normally includes a recount involving punishment (Example 10), compensation or retaliation (Example 11), behavioural change (Example 7), aborting an adventure especially in hunting expeditions, marrying another wife (Example 9), or restoration of wealth (Examples 8) (Ry/Rk). (7) Ku ntsiga nyamukazi omweburaguzo yaagucwa kabiri, ndaba omu kihambo kya maazaara kicweka emitanga. Nti tori, nti jabu. Nyetaahira, nza kusheenyera tata oruku rw'okwota (Nkutebeze 4, p. 25).

Other functions that the Runyakitara narrative Coda realises include signalling time to go to bed (after that particular story) - ... mpotoka ntemba akatabo kangye ninza kubyama; or a moral lesson for the listener - ... Nyetaahira, nza kusheenyera tata oruku rw'okwota. The Runyakitara narrative Coda equally exhibits an interesting feature that takes the listener from the story/fiction world to the present time of recounting; i.e., the real world. Like the science-fiction time machine, the narrator encounters transfiguration of the physical world or some chaos in life phenomenon to return to the time of telling the story or present times. Similar to the story of Warucuncu and Wakame (Text 2), the storyteller employs non-core lexical items (emiguutuuro) as well as metaphors to evaluate events or the participants in the story. For example, the storyteller uses such words as bwahara, ngaaha, emigyeto, gakigunuukire, ebisanga, kujwara omutanga, and kusiibya amasha omu kibuga, instead of their common equivalents such as Nyamuhango, buzima kwo, ekishongoize munonga, gakizoire, ehunga, kwerinda akabi, and kushiisha obwire, respectively. However, within the conversational segments, the language is simple and familiar in nature compared to the non-conversational stages where non-core vocabulary is invoked. So, we can tentatively conclude that emigutuuro are used in evaluation stages to assess events or participants in the story. Note that in these examples and other Runyakitara stories, the events in the story unfold in a sequence and we can clearly identify similar phases that mark these events. In other words, the generic structure is fixed; the story starts from the beginning, goes up to the end, and stops. Most of the Runyakitara narratives are similar; however, the deviations that may exist are prompted by geographical locations, which give rise to changes in names, and the songs that are used in each narrative. In the next section, we look at a modern story genre, the news story.", "category": "Grammar"}
{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the following grammar rule in Runyoro/Rutooro: A Contemporary Runyakitara New Story Genre - Amakuru", "completion": "Modernity has ushered in a different kind of stories which are detached from the traditional stories that convey the old sociocultural practices of gathering, hunting, pastoralism, farming, and artisanry such as basket weaving, blacksmithing, tribal wars, witchcraft, etc. Although some of the modern stories are largely modelled on traditional stories, they are influenced by science and technology. For example, the notions of modern science and technology exclusively influence the movie genre. Although the Runyakitara narrative genre is still largely anchored in the traditional story (because there are very limited modern storywriters in Runyakitara), we see a major shift in the stories that are recounted in the media. We now examine this different kind of story genre, the news report, as it unfolds in the print media. In newspaper reporting, news reports are referred to as \"stories\" because they recount past events (Fairclough, 1995). One major difference that distinguishes a narrative from a modern news story lies in the way events are organised in each of these genres. While there is a chronological flow of events in the narrative, events in a news story do not necessarily follow a sequential ordering; the story begins anywhere and jumps about in time and space to recount news events. The non-chronological ordering of events in a news story started with the beginning of nineteenth century when the contemporary news story emerged (Feez et al., 2010; Martin & Rose, 2008). News stories before this era followed a sequential pattern. Similarly, news reporting in Runyakitara appears to have followed a chronological ordering as exhibited Text 4.

(Source: Ageeteereine, Sunday, 8 February 1959) This news story published in Ageetereine in 1959 recounts largely three events of social unrest in pre-colonial Uganda as well as portraying the conduct of colonial administration. The story had no specific headline related to the events being recounted. The story's introduction provides a recount of the social news and chitchat about the social wellbeing of the people and the area: ... turiyo tugumire... Enjara titukigimanya; weather conditions: Omushana guriyo mwingi. Omu biro ebyayebembeirwe Christmas tukaba twine enjara nyingi munonga; and identifying agricultural activity of the moment, mbwenu turiyo nitugyesha. This is similar to the introductory phase of the traditional letter genre, which is influenced by the community sense and social obligation to provide the recipient (in this case, the putative reader) with news about the well-being or ill-being of oneself, one's family or that of the immediate community. The news reporter then highlights the core event in the next phase: Kwonka ku yaahweireho obwo aka Ibanda kaimuka. Omu biro ebi ebihingwire, omu gomborora emwe eya Mumyoka Busheshe, hagwiremu abantu bashatu. Events that first happened are recounted first: the famine, followed by good weather and harvesting. Thereafter, the disruption of the social order comes on the scene: ku yaahweireho obwo aka Ibanda kaimuka. The reporter then proceeds to elaborate each of the three news events separately. Although information in the news report does not tell the reader whether the events followed one after the other in each news event, there is a clear chronological presentation of events as highlighted by the superscripts in the second news event extract (Example 13) below (Ry/Rk): (13) Ondijo mushaija niwe Rwomire akaba arugire Buhweju afurukiire Bigyera, Yaarwana n'omukazi we. Nyamukazi yaagyenda. Yaamuronda yaabura. Yaaruga Bigyera yaataaha Buhweju, obwo aine eicumu n'omuhoro. Ab'oruganda rwe baabimwaka. Ku yaabaire naagaruka Bigyera yaayehanika omu muhanda aha mugongo Kyaikucu, omu muruka gwa Sabagaba-Mumyoka. Owaabaire naaza kusibika embuzi, yaareeba omurambwe omu muti, yaateera enduru. Abantu baahurura, n'Owegomborora yaabaijamu. (Kwonka yaaba ari omutsigire). Hakateerwa abantu b'ekyaro ekyo. Bakabateerera kimwe baabasaasa munonga..... Whereas the news writer recounts the events in a fairly objective manner, close analysis demonstrates two instances of implicit evaluation that deserve mention here. In the following proposition; Kwonka ku yaahweireho obwo aka Ibanda kaimuka, the expression aka Ibanda kaimuka evokes negative attitudinal values with regard to the people of the area, Ibanda. Although this is not explicitly mentioned, readers would associate aka with the negative perceptions [stereotypes] that people living in Ankore have on the inhabitants of Ibanda, especially witchcraft and murder. This traces its origin to the killing of one of the colonial administrators, Gault, in 1902. In another sentence: Hakateerwa abantu b'ekyaro ekyo. Bakabateerera kimwe baabasaasa munonga, the news writer's use of hakateerwa and bakabateerera kimwe aims to intensify the action, thus rendering the actions of the colonial administration distasteful. In this section, we examine a contemporary news report and describe its generic properties. It is important to define the kind of news reports that we wish to study because they are varied. In such circumstances, one media scholar, Bell (1991, p. 12) provides a context-specific definition of genre. He defines it as \"the particular kind of media content in which you [researcher/analyst] are interested\"; for example, news, classified advertising, weather forecasts, etc. For that reason, the news stories that we analyse in this chapter derive from a category of news reports known as \"hard news\". These are news stories that recount conflict, namely wars, accidents, riots, disasters, corruption, electoral violence, political violence, crime, disease outbreaks, etc. They are preferred because they are newsworthy. These events disturb the social equilibrium and are therefore, urgent to report on. They usually appear on the front pages of a newspaper, which is not necessarily the case with Runyakitara hard news reports. Studies on news reporting in the Anglo-American and other societies such as Japan, China, France, Thailand, and Indonesia demonstrate that a hard news report exhibits similar generic features. It unfolds in a non-linear progression to recount events in a given news report. The report is composed of the two major phases (stages): the opening nucleus and the body/development stage. The Nucleus is composed of a headline(s) and a lead while the second phase comprises sub-components referred to as satellites. The Nucleus contains the most significant issues of the news report presented in a summary form. Training literature recommends news reporters to ensure that this phase answers the following questions: what, who, where, when, how, and so what. The satellites go back to the Nucleus, moving in a backward and forward pattern, to explain, contextualise, elaborate or comment on the elements presented in the headline/lead opening (White, 1997; Thomson et al., 2008). A satellite paragraph restates or describes in a detailed fashion the element(s) presented in the headline/lead opening. These satellites are independent of each other. They may also position events in the time and space by describing the location of events that happened before the current event. Another satellite can, via reference to an external voice - usually a direct quotation and known as attribution in media discourse, evaluates an element of the nucleus (Feez et al., 2010; White, 1997). The generic ordering of a news report appears fixed; that is, Headline + Lead + Satellites. However, the development stage, which comprises satellites, can be reshuffled and the story would flow without any dysfunction. This generic feature is associated with hard news genres and is known as radical editability. Radical editability involves reorganising the original positions of the body satellites without creating a new genre or affecting the news report's functionality (White, 1997). However, this feature does not always apply to some news texts (Kitley, 2008). Similarly, preliminary studies of Runyakitara hard news reports have also established that because most of them unfold in a chronological manner, radical editability does not apply to them (Mugumya, 2013). It should be noted that journalists go beyond recounting events; they at times interpret those events, provide their own viewpoints either directly or indirectly: they condemn or appraise events or news actors (see Martin & White, 2005 for a detailed explanation on the language of evaluation). However, other news reports simply convey events as they happened, what is ordinarily referred to as 'objective reporting'. Let us now examine a Runyakitara hard news report to illustrate its generic properties and generic structure. Text 5 (Ry/Rk)", "category": "Grammar"}

(Source: Entatsi, March 18-14, 2001, p. 8). Text 5 recounts a political conflict in which supporters of presidential candidates were involved in electoral violence in 2001. During the electoral campaigns, two major presidential contestants are highlighted in the print media, the incumbent, Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, and his hitherto friend and personal physician during the guerrilla war in the 1980s, Dr. Col. Kizza Besigye. The present-day Runyakitara news report does not recount events of social disorder in such a manner. It does not 'waste time' in pleasantries but rather plunges into the actual event that disrupts life's order and jumps about, and without necessarily following the order in which events occur. For example, in Text 5, we observe that the news report does not recount events in a chronological manner. The story does not begin from the moment when the decoration of the streets started, which, ordinarily, would be the initial event of the story. Instead the news reporter starts from the point when the social harmony (preparations to welcome Dr. Besigye) is destabilised; that is, when the Presidential Protection Unit and Local Defence soldiers started chasing away supporters of Col. Besigye who were decorating the streets. The news report unfolds in two phases, the nucleus and the body. There is a close relationship between the headline and the lead; in other words, the elements in the lead refer back to the headline to specify each of the elements presented. This is an indication that the headline is a summary of the lead. We illustrate this relationship in the Example 14 below. The numbers (superscripts) show that the elements in the headline are repeated in the lead. (14) (14)", "category": "Grammar"}

The Headline and Lead provide the core information that summarises the entire news report. We find that the news writer largely concentrates on the information in this phase. The opening nucleus therefore serves as a summary of the news report. It indicates what - barwaine, bashenguraine; who - aba, abashagiki, abaserukare; where - omu tauni Rukungiri; when - Orwakataano 2/3/2001, but also the consequence - bahutaire. The subsequent components of the body phase serve to specify this crisis point by repeating in other words these elements highlighted in the headline/lead, opening sentence in a satellite structure. The body stage comprises four sub-components. The first satellite locates the origin of the crisis: Orutaro rutandikire obu abaserukare ba PPU n'aba LDU bairukize abashagiki ba Col. Kizza Besigye, and explains its cause: [abashagiki] barekye kweyerera n'okutimba emitumba omu tauni nk'akamanyiso k'okumwakiira (Col. Besigye) omu kitiinisa. In other words, we see the satellite going back to elaborate and provide details to the element of bashenguraine located in the lead. The second satellite also serves to explain further the details of the conflict: the removal of the driver from the truck, the pandemonium after soldiers shot in the air, the fractures sustained by supporters, and the fear of miscarriage by a pregnant woman. Satellite three returns to recount an event that occurred before the on-going social disorder: abapooriisi bakumire obusingye, abantu barikuhunda amaduuka, bategyereize omwana waabo oyetsimbire ahabwa Purezidenti. The last satellite ends the story abruptly by elaborating the violence that ensued when both supporters met each other at an identified location. There is an observed repetition of elements that refer to the crisis point; that is, disturbance of social order throughout the text - Aba [abashagiki] Museveni barwaine n'aba Besigye, abaserukare abarikukuuma Purezidenti bahutaire.

Using genre analysis, we have observed that the Runyakitara story genre bears resemblance to the story genre obtaining in the European and American societies. The Runyakitara story exhibits a similar rhetorical structure to the English-language one albeit with some differences. We have also noted that the Resolution stage, at times, may comprise a recitation or a song, which contributes to the resolution of a problem. Whereas the Coda is optional and its removal does not render the story incomplete, most Runyakitara stories apparently exhibit one. Since this is one of the preliminary attempts to analyse Runyakitara texts using genre principles, the interpretations are open to further scrutiny. More research is required to examine more texts and other genres in order to establish the occurring and non-occurring stages. More research is also welcome to enhance, supplant or critique the current scholarship. There is also need to extend similar research to other newspaper texts, for example, sports reports, features, opinion pieces, etc. Other texts like the exemplum, recount, anecdotes have not been examined due to space and time limitations. However, they do exist in Runyakitara and we exhort scholars to undertake a generic analysis of such texts. Note that the approach employed in this chapter to analyse the genre of stories can be equally applied to other Runyakitara texts. Therefore, the need to study other texts not examined here is dire, particularly, editorials, endagaano y'oburagwa (Will), and endagaano y'okuguza (Sale Agreement) because they are so far the only existing common written texts in Runyakitara.", "category": "Grammar"}

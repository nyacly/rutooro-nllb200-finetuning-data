{"type": "instruction", "instruction": "Explain the rule for noun class 9/10", "completion": "9/10 (en-/en-) and 7/8 7/8 (eki-/ebi-) respectively, the following would be the description of 'a white cow', 'a black cow' and 'a red flower': ente erikwera (a white cow), ente erikwiragura (a black cow), ekirabyo ekirikutukura (a red flower), omuntu orikwiragura (a darkskinned person). (c) Body parts: The following words among others are listed in Taylor (1985) as part of the inventory of words referring to body parts: rujuga (Adam's apple), okwahwa (armpit), omugongo (back), bladder (oruhago), omwitsyo (breath), finger (orukumu), ekigyere (foot), empiita (sweat). They represent objects/entities in the real world. However, omwitsyo (breath) and empiita (sweat) refer to entities that do not make up the framework of the body. For this reason, they would not be among the terms for body parts. Their appropriate category needs to be identified. Body respiration and body waste materials would be the immediate groupings to think about. (d) Cattle markings, botanical and personal names: Behind the names of cattle given in Taylor (1985) is the argument that the naming is based on the unique features of a cow (also emphasised in Ingfield, 2003), most of which are the markings on the skin. This is verifiable from the following names and descriptions as outlined in the work: kyasha [a cow with a] small patch on forehead mamba [a cow with a] grey and white patch(es) mbarago [a cow with a] clear brown patches mbombo [a cow with] stripped patches gaaju [a cow which is] light brown mayenje [a cow which has] black or white spots all over the body (e) Basic vocabulary: The basic Runyankore-Rukiga vocabulary listed in Taylor (1985) ranges from adjectives to verbs and nouns. It is a list which consists of about two hundred words. Examples of the words include -ona/-ena (all). This is a pronoun stem to which a noun prefix is attached. Others are: kandi; na (and), enyamaishwa (animal), aha (at), omugongo (back), enyima (behind) and -tiina (fear), sic. okutiina, v. (fear). The infinitive form as in the foregoing example is the natural form for citation of verbs. In attempting to give the basic vocabulary of a language, one is aiming at showing the main stream vocabulary of that language. Rubongoya (1999) The work presents a section of the noun class system and the supposed semantic properties associated with nouns in each class. Noun classes are identified as shown below: (a) Nouns of class 1: Examples are: omuntu (person), omwana (child), omunyaihanga (foreigner), omulimambogo (gardener), cultivation (of vegetables), is (taken as having a relative meaning equivalent to the meaning of the agentive suffix '-er' in 'gardener'. The question is whether the relative meaning originates from the preprefix (initial vowel), the (noun prefix or both. If the form was mulimambogo), without (the initial vowel), the (relative meaning is inconceivable. The noun prefix -mu- which remains denotes 'omuntu' (person), abaisiki (plural form of omwisiki (girl), abaana (children), omwegi (learner), this (class caters for nouns that do not have the prefix), e (.g. names of people as proper nouns. Its counterpart noun class 1 caters for common nouns. (d), they (form class 2a. Examples given in Rubongoya (1999), Baarubuga (queen sisters), nouns (of class 5), nouns (of class 6), nouns (of class 7 and 8), and (nouns of class 9 and 10. Others are nouns of classes 9a and 10a), nouns (of class 11), nouns (of classes 12), and (nouns of class 15 .), For (each class of nouns), Rubongoya (1999), there (seems not to be a direct link between the meaning and the entity it represents. The meaning can be perceived (in mind), it (is akin to the mentalist view of how words make meaning. The mentalist view of meaning holds that words denote the mental picture of an entity rather than the entity itself. Therefore), the (word book denotes bound pieces of paper for reading or writing. The mental picture denoted by a word is a concept that is aroused in mind by the word. Hence), words (denote concepts), and (not 'things'), directly (in their physical form. This conception of meaning is criticised for denying a direct link between a word and the 'thing' it refers to.), The (aforementioned conceptual representationof meaning is illustrated in the following semantic triangle devised by Ogden and Richards (1985), Figure (5.1. Semantic triangle According to the triangle), a (word is symbol for the concept stored in mind (thought), thing (or object that exists (somewhere), according (to this conception of meaning), there (is no direct link between a word and its referent. As noted above), this (conception of meaning is criticised for denying a direct link between a word and the 'thing'. This criticism is based on the fact that the concept underlying the 'thing' cannot be easily seen as the thing itself.), In (line with semantic properties), examples (of Runyoro-Rutooro nouns and their semantic properties are outlined in Rubongoya (1999), an (exception is observed that not all nouns for living things are included in this class (e.g.), nouns (for class 1 and 2), e (.g.), igamba (derived from okugamba 'speak'), 'say ('), 'denote ('), ibara (name), igamba (talk about someone's actions or behaviour), igesa (harvest), reaping (time), izaara (anyone of the times when a woman gives birth), igenda (travel), n (.), ihiisa (brew), temporal (noun), isaija (manliness), isigazi (boyhood), eryana (childhood), eriiru ([servitude] (c), inanimate (objects), abstract (s), emotional (values. (d), names (of colours), names (of grasshoppers (insects), names (of domestic animals), among (others. These are taken to be semantic properties of these nouns in Rubongoya (1999), but (they are mere types of such words that appear in these noun classes. On the whole), there (are many ways in which the word forms under each of the noun classes represent objects that exist in the world. However), the (categorisation), of (words in terms of the different semantic properties as outlined above would not be as consistent if a category like nouns for class 3 and 4 are taken to be nouns referring to living things), yet (others that refer to living things cannot fit in these particular noun classes. Class 5 nouns in Rubongoya (1999), there (is no difference between igamba (talk), Semantic (Fields), This (sub-section focuses on ways of categorisation of words. The different ways are presented), compared (and evaluated. Then), it (is shown how they represent semantic isomorphism of language in terms of their frameworks. Together), they (are viewed under a broader theory of semantic fields. A semantic field is a set of words (or lexemes), a (set of the words referring to different colours is a semantic field. This field is referred to as 'words for colour'), or (as 'colour terms'. Therefore), a (semantic field for colour terms would include words such as red), gree (n), blac (k), purpl (e), whit (e), orang (e), blu (e), among (others. Figure 5.2 below shows a semantic field of colour terms.), Figure (5.2. A semantic field of colour terms The words in a semantic field share a common semantic property), i (.e. subject matter. For instance), the (semantic field for colour terms consists of all words referring to colour.), Museveni (et al. (2012), semantic (fields), earth (and cosmology [2] Words for plants), milk (and meat [9] Words for work and the world of skills [10] Words to do with dressing), ornaments (and perfumes [11] Words for travel on land), water (and in the air. Each of the broad domains of words has sub-domains. For instance), the (domain for words of plants has these sub-domains with corresponding words. Examples in Museveni et al. (2012), where (the source is not indicated), Words (for plants amacanda (sunflowers), eishaari (tree branch), Words (for grasses), creepers (and weeds ekiraare (weeds), Words (for mushrooms), mosses (and weeds ebituzi (large edible mushrooms), ekituzi (large edible mushroom), Museveni (et al. (2012), namel (y), abstract (relation), spac (e), matte (r), intellec (t), volition (will), he (looked at the concepts/things and named them. The names of the concepts formed the vocabulary), English (vocabulary in this case. For), instanc (e), for (the concept of 'affections' in Roget (1987), the (following classification is found:), Affection (: general terms), persona (l), sympatheti (c), mora (l), religiou (s), Moral (: obligation), sentiment (s), condition (s), practic (e), institution (s), Practice (: temperance), intemperanc (e), sensualis (m), asceticis (m), etc (.), Following (both the natural order of things approach and the philosophical dimension approach), it (is assumed that it is possible to divide up the vocabulary of a language into semantic fields), much (as the two approaches do not yield the same results. Both approaches can also create cross-cutting terms), that (is), terms (which belong to more than one domain. For instance), in (English), love (n.), ekiraare (weeds), Crystal (2003), p (. 104), For (instance), whereas (it is easy to make a perfect semantic field for words to do with 'body parts' or 'names of fruits'), it (is not quite the same for words to do with 'noise' or 'ornaments' (things used for decoration), According (to Crystal (2003), some (words for \"noise\" or \"ornaments\" will not seem to be exactly belonging to the same concept. Examples are music and watch respectively. Cross-cutting terms and fitness of a term in a semantic field create a challenge of getting a consistent approach for establishing semantic fields), and (therefore), the (need to continue looking for more consistent (precise), The (question is: under what semantic approach can words be perfectly divided? This is one end that some linguists could have come to in search for perfect divisions of words. The situation-role theory enunciated in Kiingi (2009), divisions (of all things are enunciated), as (in Table 5.3 below.), Table (5.3. Division of all things), The (list is a range of entities that exist. All sub-entities that fall under an entity have 'names'. Examples are shown in Table 5.3 under the column for objects. The names are the words in the vocabulary of a language. For instance), the (term 'flower' is under 'plant' because a leaf is a plant object. The term 'house' is under material objects. This shows that what is in the language is also in the world), and (most likely vice versa. Hence), the (terms 'four' and 'tomorrow' come under quantity and temporal objects respectively. These kinds of divisions qualify to be the domains of words. The above are taken as the domains into which the mind divides up all things.), Apart (from the domains and the terms (words), the (situa-tion-role theory specifies that the entities referred to by the terms (words), and (the actions are spoken about. For example), 'a (flower withers'. This is an action which is a result of force/conditions of nature. Seen from another example), a (number is counted or added to another.), It (is possible that when actions take place), they (are spoken about. Speech is in terms of sentences. Sentences follow the logical order of the action (depending on the language), the (order of the event 'a flower withers'), has (the intrinsic structure 'something changes'), which (in speech (in English expression), that (is), The (flower withered or The flower has withered.), Kiingi (2008a), Kiingi (2008b), Table (5.4: Roles played by entities), To (view the above as actions), we (can talk of 'changes'), 'causations ('), 'nonchanges ('), etc (. On the other hand), they (can be considered as roles if seen against the background of the entities that perform them), for (example), in ('The car is moving slowly'), 'move (verb), 'open' (denotes causation (that is), the (key causes the door to open), Based (on the the situation-role theory), whose (concepts are semantic categories and semantic-roles as listed and symbolised above), sentences (can be symbolically formalised to show their semantic structure (thst is), patter (n), as (in the examples below. (The upper-case symbols are from Table 5.4 and the lower-case symbols are from Table 5.3), Sentence (: He turned a traitor.), Formalization (that is), semantic (structure), semantic (structure), The (semantic situation-role theory has practical implications for lexicon (vocabulary), it (is possible for one to choose to compile a lexicon (vocabulary), e (.g. 'leaves'. It will not make sense to compile the terms of all leaves), but (for a particular type of leaves), and (in a particular way. For instance), in (Runyakitara), it (makes sense to compile the specific names of leaves of types of plants. Examples are (), Ry (/Rk), Ry (/Rk), or (a lexicon in general terms.), For (a defining dictionary), the (semantic situation-role theory has the implication that meanings of words can be determined on the basis of the action that impacts on an entity. For instance), in ('The car is moving slowly' we know that 'to move' is to change in space relative to a location. For a 'car' in particular and other things which 'move'), the (definition of 'to move would be to go from one point to another'.), A (new meaning can also be sought if a different entity were the one undergoing the action (of the verb), e (.g. 'The time is moving slowly'. In this case), 'move' (means 'to complete a cycle'. It shows that if a different entity other than the normal entity performs the action), the (implied meaning changes. This is an aspect of metaphoricity), and (therefore meaning extension. How is this? 'move' as an example), is (normally in relation to concrete objects if they change in space from one position to another. A non-concrete object such as time cannot be said to 'move' in this context. In cases where this verb is used to refer to time or any other non-concrete object), then (the intended meaning is metaphorical (an extension of the basic meaning), Als (o), it (is possible to use the semantic situation-role theory to write a systematic thesaurus. For instance), in (terms of synonyms), the (words 'price' (n.), semantic (category), it (needs to be put under quantity objects. Therefore), the (specific meaning of words will be the basis of grouping words as synonyms under the different domains. This explains why 'price' and 'measure' may not be synonymous in certain cases. Indeed), it (is the reason the two words are not direct synonyms), of (each other in the following list of synonyms recorded in Fergusson (1986), p (. 323), n (. cost), expens (e), fe (e), rat (e), charg (e), valu (e), wort (h), amoun (t), figur (e), expenditur (e), outla (y), valuatio (n), assessmen (t), estimat (e), quotatio (n), bount (y), reward (. measure), n (. size), magnitud (e), quantit (y), amoun (t), exten (t), degre (e), scop (e), range (. Using semantic categories to identify synonyms), it (is justified to have the word endorero (Runyankore-Rukiga), p (. 161), whereby (the meaning situates the words in the domain of material objects: endorero (n.), Akahengyere (aku baabire bafumura omu kisiika ngu abakazi bareeberemu abagyenyi omu ... ibanga), ahabw'okuba (bakaba bataikirizibwa kuzayo kubareeba nari kubahikaho. (A hole in one of the rooms in the house), which (was used by women to see visitors. Women were not allowed to see visitors or come close to them.), Ekifumuka (ky'orwigi eki baabaire bareeberamu enyamaishwa nari omuzigu aheeru nyekiro. (A hole in the door through which one observed an animal or enemy when it is outside at night.), the (word endorero is a sub-set of ekifumuka. The latter includes the meaning of the former. Nonetheless), they (depict entities that belong to the same domain), i (.e. material object.), Similarl (y), the (Runyoro-Rutooro word enkamyo (n.), p (. 44), which (can be a justification for this: enkamyo (n.), Clearl (y), in (terms of semantic isomorphism of language), the (semantic role-theory of language is reflective of situations that happen independent of language. It tells us of the phenomena (objects/entities), but (which are encoded in language (for purposes of communication), there (are objects/entities whose names have been illustrated through examples. The examples are), therefor (e), part (of the vocabulary of Runyakitara. An attempt has been made to show how this vocabulary can be categorized systematically into ways in which the mind divides up all things. This has been done on the basis of the semantic situation-role theory. In the next section), emphasis (now will be put on situations that take place and how they are encoded and expressed in language. The analysis will be based on the semantic situation-role theory (explained in the preceding section), with (examples taken from English and Runyakitara.), Situation (s), their (Encoding and Expression in Language), Events (happen independent of language. For instance), the (event (that is), the (situation), these (particular situations could be exressed as:), The (leaf deacayed or The water boils), Both (correspond to the sentence pattern Subject + Verb (SV), Omwana (yaarira (The child has cried), and (Omuti gukooma (The tree dried up), we (can show the propositional form of the situations expressed by the sentences.

This process is called meaning widening (or broadening), Below (are the different ways in which words change in meaning), as (described in Murray (1996), in (addition to its previous sense or senses. For Runyakitara), the (examples in Table 5.5 above), are (cases of semantic broadening. A word gains a new meaning without losing its former meaning. (ii), the (word omwigarire which used to mean 'king's wife'), today (refers more to 'handmaid of God' in the religious sense (Christianity), the (word omushumba which used to mean 'employee' and 'cow-herder'), today (refers more to 'pastor' (in Pentecostalism), and (this portrays gradual semantic narrowing. (iii), and (takes on a new), but (often related meaning. For example), i (n), Runyankore (Rukiga the word omukago meant a blood-sealed friendship), but (today it means any form of close friendship. Similarly), the (word okuramya meant worshipping a traditional god), but (today it means Christian worship. (iv), suppression (of meaning), the (meaning of the word omuhuuku (male slave), telling (them that he/she is not their servant. In this case the former meaning is suppressed. Incidentally), this (trend of usage of the words is steadily gaining momentum. In religious terms (Christianity), the (word omuhuuku is constantly used to refer to 'servant of God' or to 'those who are humble before God'. However), this (trend of change of meaning has not affected the word omuzaana (female slave), thus (supressing its actual sense. Another example in Runyankore-Rukiga is the expression abanyabuzaare n'abanyamikago), which (in its strict sense means 'relatives and friends'. It is normally used as a phrase in announcing the death of someone), but (whenever it is used the sense that is carried is: 'all the people who know the deceased' other than 'relatives and friends'. (v), donates (disapproval), expressions (like abairu baawe (your servants), the (word omwiru (a materially poor person), it (is adopted in expressions like omwiru wa Ruhanga (God's son or daughter), although (without losing its original meaning. The word okuhweza (to visualise), i (.e. 'to see with one's eyes'. The speakers may use the word in constructions such as Abo bakahweza kare), baine (entunguuka (Those became clever), they (have developed), engondoore (ram), instea (d), are (used to mean the same entities), i (.e.), egaar (i), empaya (y'entaama and egooti/ekooti respectively. The processes of lexical change (as described above), Whether (it is lexical change or semantic change), there (is need to examine the intrinsic factors that underlie these processes. Taking an example of entomi (fist), the (entity it refers to denotes a biotic object. It extended in meaning to 'bribe'), which (denotes a material object.

Therefore), the (word 'vehicle' represents what exists in the real world in virtual form.), Like (other languages), Runyakitara (words denote entities that have concrete and virtual existence in terms of hyponymy and hypernymy.

The latter sense relations are referred to as homonymy (that is), the (sameness of the shape of words), Homonyms (are of different types), namel (y), homologues (and homomorphs. Homologues are of two sub-categories: homographs and homophones. Homographs are different words with the same spelling. Homophones are words of different spelling but with the same pronunciation. Crystal (2003), and ('threw' vs. 'through' for homophones. Homomorphs are same shape of words belonging to different parts of speech), e (.g. 'water' (n.), Although (different in shape), homonyms (as words represent different entities in the real world. However), the (language form makes them similar or different in shape. The origin of the shape for homophones may be quite clear: similar pronunciation of words. The same goes for homomorphs), which (are a result of conversion. It is not clear what the origin of homographs is. Lyons (1977), Crystal (2003), while (the latter is derived from 'Oporto' the name of a city in Portugal through which wine was exported. It is also noted in this work that the name of the city came from the Portuguese expression 'o porto' which meant 'the harbour' and originated from Latin 'porto'. From this background we note that since the words in question denote unrelated concepts (harbour and drink), win (e), that (is), word (. Therefore), instead (of having one word for both meanings (polysemy), each (is denoted by a different word (homonymy), In (Runyakitara), words (are spelt according to how they are pronounced unlike in English), for (instance), where (it is not the case. There is no mismatch between phonetic and phonemic representation in Runyakitara. Runyakitara words such as omukama (king), a (language with matching phonetic and phonemic representation as Runyakitara is not expected to have homophones. Homomorphs are also not expected since they come about as a result of stress placement. Being a non tresstimed language), Runyakitara (is not expected to enlist homomorphs.), Runyakitara (has homographs such as shown below for Runyankore-Rukiga: omuti (tree), engoma (drum), amahembe (horns), while (the entities they represent are to the world.

On the other hand), Babcock (2002), p (. 2429), translation (is to turn into one's own language or another language), to (make a new version by rendering into another language. And as a noun), translation (is an act), proces (s), or (instance of translating as a rendering from one language or representational system into another. Translation is an art that involves the recreation of a work in another language for readers of a different background.), According (to Bassnett (1991), translation (is the rendering of a Source Language (SL), Brislin (1976), whether (the languages are in a written or oral form), whether (the languages have established orthographies or do not have such standardisation), or (whether one or both languages are based on signs), as (with sign language of the deaf.), Venute (1995), p (. 17), which (the translator provides on the strength of an interpretation\". Finally), Larson (1984), The (above definitions have a number of things in common. There is consensus among the different scholars mentioned above that translation involves transfer of information from one language (SL), not (be the exact equivalents of what was in the SL. But there should be semantic harmony in both languages to make sure that the meaning in the SL is the same in the TL. The translator must avoid semantic shift), which (would lead to misinformation. The setting of the text for translation should also be maintained), the (styles), broadly (speaking), must (be equivalent), or (comparable. The form), therefor (e), must (be maintained in relation to the structure of a given language. Larson (1973), phrase (s), clause (s), sentence (s), paragraph (s), etc (.), which (form the surface structure of the language. The translated version should therefore), have (a dynamic equivalence if it cannot get the exact equivalents.), What (Does the Form of the Language Include?), According (to Larson (1973), p (. 3), the (form of the language includes \"the actual words), phrase (s), clause (s), sentence (s), paragraphs (etc.\"), which (form the surface structure of the language. For example), in (the sentence: (a), The (actual words are: the slow cat was knocked by a fast car), and (they form a sentence. This sentence is subdivided into subject and predicate), thus (:), This (structure (of subject and predicate), The (words: Omwana mubi akaiba omuyembe make the form of the sentence. Therefore), if (we were to translate the first sentence into Runyakitara and the second sentence into English), the (words would change their form. The English form), would (not remain as English), neither (would the Runyakitara form remain Runyakitara. Therefore), the (translations of sentences (a), in (the target languages), they (are eight (8), still (there would be a change in form.), One (important point to note is that), whereas (the form of the source text changes in language), the (meaning does not change. This is because), if (the meaning was to change), then (the intended message would change. Thus), the (rule to remember in translation is keeping the original meaning as original as possible), even (if it means changing the form. For example), in (the following translated sentences), the (form and structure are maintained but the meaning drifted.), For (all the sentences), the (form has been maintained but the meaning has shifted), which (has distorted the intended message.), Thu (s), according (to Larson (1984), p (. xiii), grammatical (structure), communication (situation and cultural context of the source language text), analysing (it in order to determine its meaning and then reconstructing this same meaning using the lexicon and grammatical structure which are appropriate in the receptor language and its cultural context.), In (that context), the (proper translation for the above example should be as follows: i), Rn (/Rt: Kamu kamu nigwo muganda.), It (should be noted that the source language is the one from which the translation is made and the receptor or target language is the language into which the translation is made. However), you (may have noticed that whereas in the source language one form may be expressed by one word), in (the receptor language), it (may be expressed by more than one word and vice versa. For example:), Ry (/Rk: Ekitabo ky'omwegyesa The teacher's book The book for the teacher The book which belongs to the teacher The book owned by the teacher. All these are different forms expressing one meaning. Due to differences required in form to convey a certain meaning), the (translator must choose the best form which expresses the meaning in the most natural way in the receptor language. In doing this), the (appropriate vocabulary), idioms (and expressions), must (be chosen to put the message across.), Reasons (for Translation), There (are various reasons that justify why documents should be translated from one language to another. These include the need for accessibility. Most innovations take place in a language the person who has innovated speaks or uses. In most cases), all (that information is in that language. Unless the innovation is rendered into another language), the (innovation may remain in the source language and yet the beneficiaries of the innovation speak a different language. Innovations can therefore), be (accessible to other languages if there is translation.), Secondl (y), new (inventions are usually accompanied with instructions on how to use a product. However), the (inventers may not speak more than one language and yet what they have invented is for usage across the globe. Such instructions can be followed if they are written in a language that is understood by many people. This is important especially when it comes to medical prescriptions.), Thirdl (y), translation (is a discipline in its own right. There are some people who have specialised in translation. At the same time), translation (is one of the activities that are time consuming and require skills), knowledge (and good command of both the source and target language. This exercise), therefor (e), cannot (be offered free of charge. Those who engage in translation have to be paid.), The (fourth reason for translating is that some written information and knowledge can only be accessed if one knows the languages it is written in. In certain cases), some (languages are dead. The only way information or knowledge of that nature can be retrieved is through translation. For example), Latin (is a dead language), it (has no native speakers who use it as their mother tongue), but (there are documents still written in that language. It also continues to be taught in schools. Documents written in Latin can only be accessed when translated.), Lastl (y), sharing (information comes about due to diversity in languages. In Uganda alone), there (are four main language groups. Within these languages), there (are dialects whose level of mutual intelligibility is low. With English as the official language and yet local languages dominate social discourse), access (to information can only be achieved through translation. Likewise), some (information that is in international languages can be shared if translated. For example), the (Bible is the most widely translated book in the world yet its source languages are Hebrew and Greek.), History (of Translation in Uganda), According (to Bassnett (1991), translation (studies cannot be complete if not considered in a historic perspective. Translation), according (to Jacobsen (1958), p (. 43), Bassnett (1991), which (followed sense by sense transfer of messages. However), a (paper presented by Pardo (2013), In (Uganda), the (Bible has been the most widely translated book. Most of the main languages have a translated version. The Bible Society embarked on translating it into all the languages of Uganda that have an orthography. It was first translated into Luganda and its first section came out in 1887. In 1893), the (New Testament was published and the complete Bible was first published in 1896. This was followed by Runyoro Bible that was published in 1913. The Runyankore-Rukiga Bible was published in three parts with the first part coming out in 1957. This was followed by the New Testament that was published in 1962 and the full version was published in 1964. In 1989), it (was revised and Apocrypha books were translated and included.), The (Bible in Acholi was published in part for the first time in 1905. The New Testament was first published in 1933 while the whole Bible was first published in), For (the Lango language), part (of the Bible was published in 1967. The New Testament was first published in 1974 while the complete Bible was first published in 1979. Lugbara had the first part of the Bible published for the first time in 1922. This was followed by the New Testament that was first published in 1936. In 1966), the (first complete Bible was published. Ateso got the first part of the Bible published in 1910. In 1930), the (New Testament was first published. The complete Ateso Bible was first published in 1961. Other languages that the Bible was translated into are Ngakarimojong), Rufumbir (a), Rukonjo (and more recently), the (New Testament was translated into Lusoga), Lumasaab (a), Lugwere (and Lusamia-Lugwe.), Other (literary works have also been translated from English into RunyankoreRukiga and Luganda. They include Washington Irving's Rip Van Winkle (1819), Chinua (Achebe's Things Fall Apart (1958), George (Orwell's Animal Farm (1945), part (of Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart (1958), Song (of Lawino Song of Ocol into Luganda as Omulanga gwa Lawino by A. Kiyimba in 2014. However), the (examples show that only one genre of literature has been given a lot of attention), i (.e. literary prose. This means that other genres of literature and other works of scholarship have not had a chance to share knowledge of this magnitude. The situation has possibly been so because), though (RunyankoreRukiga has been written since the 1950s), it (came to be established as an academic discipline in 1990 when it started to be taught as part of \"Runyakitara\" at Makerere University. Before this), there (was no urgent need to translate works from other languages for academic purposes.), As (noted above), most (of the works that have been translated fall within the discipline of literature. However), the (current competitive global trends demand that people be adequately informed if they are to compete favourably. People must get empowered through information if they are to survive in what has been termed as a global village. People need to be empowered with basic knowledge and skills to progress. Most of the knowledge that drives the world today is not available in our indigenous languages but is in what are known as international languages. Yet), people (operate in their local or indigenous languages. If the cycle of ignorance and poverty that is a burden to our people is to be broken), we (must avail this knowledge to them in the languages in which they operate. This will lead to indigenisation of knowledge and may contribute to breaking the current cycle of poverty.), Types (of Translation), There (are various types of translation in the translation exercise. Their classification is mainly governed by the purpose of the translation. According to Bassnet (1991), they (are the following:), The (first type is referred to as Literal Translation. This type of translation is formbased. It is a word per word translation. It does not usually give the original meaning of the source text as languages do not normally have a one-to-one correspondence of forms because of the different syntactic forms. However), for (purposes of linguistic analysis), one (may need a literal translation. For example: English: The President of Uganda gave a table made of wood to his close friend. Rn/Rt: Mukuru w'ihanga lya Uganda akaha emeeza ekozerwe omu rubbaho ha we ali haihi munywani. Or English: What is your father's name? Ry/Rk: Ni riiha ryasho eiziina? As you have noticed), the (literal translation does not make much sense in Runyakitara. The second type is Idiomatic Translation. This is a type of translation which tries to use the natural forms of the receptor language and tries to sound as natural as possible. According to Larson (1973), p (. 16), in (Runyakitara too), when (we translate), we (must sound as natural as possible. For example: English: No sooner had I sat down), than (I was terribly attacked by thieves. Ry/Rk: Nkaba naayehuumuzaho nti), abashuma (bantaahirira n'obukambwe. Rn/Rt: Nkaba nakaikarra nti), nkarora (abasuma nibantaagura noobukambwe. The third type is Pragmatic Translation. This is sometimes referred to as idiomatic translation. It involves the treatment of technical documents in which information about something is transferred into another language for immediate use. Brislin (1976), the (translator tries to use the natural forms of the receptor language and has to be as natural as possible. For Example), while (repairing an engine), it (may have an instruction that is reflected in the sentence below), English (: Replace with a new cup. Ry/Rk: Taho ekifundikizo ekisya. Ideally), a (cup in Runyankore-Rukiga is ekikopo. However), when (you are translating), pragmatism (is important to get what could be its equivalent and you end up with ekifundikizo), whic (h), in (Runyankore-Rukiga is lid.), The (fourth type is referred to as Ethnographic Translation. This is the type used in explicating the cultural context of the source and second language versions. Brislin (1976), while (translating the Lord's Prayer), it (becomes '), the (equivalent words are of ethnographic nature.), The (fifth type is Aesthetic-Poetic Translation. This is a form of translation that contains heroic), couplet (and dramatic dialogue. It is influenced by the effect of the poet. In other words), this (form of translation puts into account the feelings and any information used by the original author and might digress quite a bit from source language. This form of translation is important when translating poems and songs where the rhythm has to be maintained. For example), Songs (of Solomon: 2: 2-4), when (translated), it (becomes: English: Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods), Ry (:), Nk (′oku), N (k), oku (omuti gw'omucungwa guba omu kibira), English (: so is my lover among men. Ry: na nkunzi yangye nikwo aba omu batsigazi. English: In his shadow I delight to sit), Ry (: Nkashutama omu kicuucu kye nshemereirwe munonga), English (: and his fruit is sweet to my taste. Ry:), ebijuma (bye byannurira. English: He brought me to the banquet hall), Ry (: Yantaasya omunju y'obugyenyi), English (: and his glance at me signalled love. Ry: yandeebesa amaisho ga Rukundo. Linguistic Translation is the sixth type of translation we shall consider. This type of translation is concerned with equivalent meanings of the constituent morphemes of the target language (TL), for (instance), if (one was to translate from Runyankore to Rutooro in the following sentence: Rn: Omwana onu agende Ry: Omwana ogu agyende), The (Translation Process), The (fact that translation involves far more than a working acquaintance with two languages is aptly summed up by Levy (1963), not (a monistic composition), but (an interpenetration and conglomerate of two structures. On the one hand there are the semantic content and the formal contour of the original), on (the other hand), the (entire system of aesthetic features bound up with the language of the translation. The above means that translation is not just something superficial or even artificial), you (need to know both the source language (SL), Muranga (1992), even (danger and difficulty), whenever (the translator has to use all the creative powers at his disposal in order to salvage a meaning from the hazards of cross-cultural transfer. He notes \"... the translator is like a ferryman trying to ferry some people across a river. He must use all the paddling skills at his disposal and), in (case of trouble), all (his creative energy and wisdom in order to bring his passengers safely across\" (p.3), Nida (and Taber (1969), p (. 16), Figure (6.1: The translation process The process of translation is explained in the flow chart above. To execute the process), one (needs the relevant linguistic and aesthetic), ethnographi (c), pragmatic (skills. It shows that the SL text should be comprehended before any actual translation work begins. Thereafter), the (text should be analysed in order to determine how it should be translated. After that), the (process of transferring the message from the SL to the TL follows. This is accompanied by transfer of the message to the TL), without (distorting it. The message in the TL must be at least approximate to that of the SL. This approximate dimension is emphasized by Bassnett (1991), p (. 2), and (2), Larson (1984), for (her part), explains (that in translation), the (translator needs to study and analyse the lexicon), grammatical (structure), communication (situation and the cultural context. This is done in order to determine the meaning), which (is reconstructed using the lexicon and grammatical structure that are appropriate in the receptor language and its cultural context.), On (the other hand), Venute (1995), it (should sound natural and feel original.), According (to Hillaire (1931), the (translator should consider the work to be translated as an integral unit and translate it in sections), asking (him/herself before each section what the whole sense is that he has to render. He should render idiom-by-idiom and intention-by-intention), bearing (in mind that the intention of a phrase in one language may be more or less emphatic than the form of the phrase in another language. This), therefor (e), shows (that the translator of literary prose), for (example), has (the right to ignore some of the stylistic aspects of the SL text in order to conform to the stylistics and idiomatic norms of the receptor language that are most natural and acceptable in the TL.), To (sum it up), the (process of translating should involve: i), We (should note that from experience), translation (can be effective if the translator follows the following steps: Begin by reading through the text to be translated. This involves reading of the text so that you become familiar with it. The second step is identifying the language register. You should always endeavour to establish if the source text is legal), medica (l), religiou (s), etc (. This helps in choosing the appropriate vocabulary to be used. The third step is to knowing the target beneficiaries of the translation. This is important because it gives an idea of what type of language one should use. If the target is readers whose formal education is limited to primary level), there (may be need to use simple language. The fourth step is identifying the required reference materials. Some translations require wider consultations. When a translator gets the text to be translated), it (is important to identify the different resources that may be required to use during the process. It is imperative that the), translator (identifies the human resource that may be useful and contacts them. For example), if (the text is legal), it (is good to have a lawyer within reach. This also applies to medical texts. As a fifth step), it (advisable to seek to know the likely consequences of your actions. As a translator), it (is important to know the risks involved in misrepresenting facts. This is because a mistake can cost life or lead to imprisonment of an innocent person. For every document to be translated), ensure (that it does not move an inch away from the original meaning.), You (are now ready for the sixth step), which (is translating the work. If you are sure that all the above have been appropriately addressed), you (should embark on the translation. This is followed by back-translation as the seventh step. This is the process of re-translating the work back into the source language. It is done by an independent person that has not accessed the original work whose text is what has been translated. It is usually a source of conflict. The back-translator may write a different text. When the back-translation is done), the (most important aspect should be to establish that the texts are closely related. This is because it is impossible to get the original document as it was written initially), no (two persons can think alike. Secondly), the (structure of the SL and the TL vary from one another.), The (eighth and final stage is to harmonise the translation. After back-translation has been finished), it (is important to get all the three texts together and harmonize the work to come up with a single working document. The translation and back-translation should be harmonised to reflect what was in the initial text. It is at this stage that translation is considered complete. After all that has been done), you (should then ask yourself the following questions: i), the (n), the (translation will have been accomplished.), Challenges (in Translation), The (process of translation has its own challenges that are experienced. Various factors are responsible for this phenomenon. These include the following: a), The (lack of concept in receptor language is the first major challenge. Although it has been said that a translator must try to sound as natural as possible), it (is quite difficult to come up with the appropriate expressions because there is no one-to-one lexical equivalence across languages. There are times when the source text talks about a concept or object that does not exist in the receptor language. What does one do in such a case? For example:), ST (: The robot was talking like a human being. Which of the three sentences below translates the above sentence to the satisfaction of the speaker of Runyankore? Why? i), kikaba (nikigambira kimwe nk'omuntu.), Beekman (and Callow (1974), Usage (of a generic word with a phrase), Usage (of a loan-word), o (r), Usage (of a cultural substitute. a), There (are times when a translator has to translate a concept or idea which does not exist in his/her language. He/she needs to understand clearly the words and their meaning in the source language and how they are used in the different contexts. He/she needs to know the form and functions of the different lexical items in the language. The form of a word includes the physical attributes of the object being talked about. For example), the (form of the car includes its size), colou (r), shape (and its parts. But the function is to transport people and things. A translator needs to know well the functions and forms of words as they might differ from language to language.), For (one to come up with such a descriptive phrase of 'robot'), he (/she must know how the robot looks like and what it does. Thus), a (translator needs to be widely read and very knowledgeable in various disciplines.), At (this stage), we (need to note that even when the form and function of the lexical items are very much similar), they (might have different associations in the two languages. For example), bread (may be the same in both languages but with different functions. Whereas in Runyakitara bread may be a special treat for breakfast), in (English it may be taken as daily food. If one chooses the generic term with a descriptive phrase to cater for the new concept being translated), there (are various ways in which the generic term can be dealt with.), As (explained by Larson (1973), in (the modification of form approach), the (translator describes the generic form of the word to be translated. For example), if (translated into Runyankore), it (is:), Another (way in which a word could be translated is by making explicit its function. For example:), In (other instances), one (may decide to use both the form and the function to describe a new concept in the receptor language. Thus), robot (ekyoma ekikozirwe nk'omuntu ekirikukora buli karimo nk'omuntu. aeroplane ekyoma ky'amapapa ekirikugendera omu mwanya), ekitwara (abantu), n (′), ebintu (. The translator can also use a comparison of something in the receptor language to that in the source language. For example: ekitiiho tonto Or muha something like a big spoon a wine-like brew a dog-like animal.), There (are times when a loan-word may be used to bring about lexical equivalence. When this is done), the (word is usually modified to fit into the linguistic structure of the receptor language. Also), when (the word is introduced), it (is usually described. If you consider our first translation of 'robot'), we (used a loan-word with a RunyankoreRukiga description), thus (:), Ekyoma (ekimanywa nka robboti), kikaba (nikigambira kimwe nk'omuntu. After the introduction of such a word in the language), it (is later assimilated as a borrowed word.), In (the translation of the Draft Constitution (1993), many (loan-words were adopted as Runyakitara words and they are now being used. Words like Konsitityusoni (Runyoro-Rutooro), Konsitityushoni (Runyankore-Rukiga), There (are times when any of the above-mentioned possibilities does not seem appropriate. Here), the (translator may choose a cultural substitute from the receptor lan-), guage (. However), the (translator must be very careful as sometimes the cultural substitute may not give the near equivalent), especially (if the term does not exist. Thus), Larson's (1973), pp (. 163-176), the (translator must be very careful about the terms he/she chooses. For example), it (is translated as: Okutangirira okw'ekitiinisa ky'amaani. ii), if (a descriptive equivalent suits the situation better), it (is advisable that it is used rather than the cultural substitute. iii), it (may be difficult for the speakers to understand what is being described. In this case), it (would be better to use a cultural substitute. However), the (translator is cautioned to be faithful to historical events. He/she should not change the truth of a historical fact because he/she wants to use a cultural substitute. For example), these (are some of the cultural substitutes.), The (second major challenge faced by translators is associated with figurative language. This can be explained as a language that uses words), groups (of words or expressions that exaggerate or alter the usual meanings with a meaning that is different from the literal interpretation. Figurative language can also bring about difficulties in translation. This is because the figures of speech such as metaphors), simile (s), idiom (s), allusion (s), hyperboles (or puns may not always have corresponding equivalents in the source language and receptor/target language. For example), it (may not be easy to translate an expression like \"it rained cats and dogs\" or \"I smell a rat\". Larson (1973), p (. 254), which (are figures of speech:), Keeping (the metaphor if it sounds natural in the receptor language.), Translating (the metaphor as a simile using 'like' or 'as'.), Substituting (an equivalent metaphor from the receptor language.), Keeping (the metaphor and explaining the meaning.), Translating (the meaning of the metaphor without keeping the metaphorical imagery.), The (existence of untranslatable words is the third challenge that is faced during translation. Untranslatable words do not have an equivalent in the target language. This is because of the cultural uniqueness that exists. As a result), some (words or expressions are in one language while they are not in another. When such a situation arises), it (is imperative to get an expression that is equivalent. In case that is not possible), the (translator has no option other than naturalising the word or expression. This means that the person writes the word as it is pronounced in the source language but follows the rules of orthography of the target language. The other alternative is to borrow from a neighbouring language.), The (fourth challenge to translation is emotional torture. This occurs when a translator), in (the process of translation), has (to translate texts that have emotional attachment. It may happen that one is hired to translate a document that may result in loss of life or property and the information is not yet published. The challenge would be whether to report such a situation to authorities yet it is against the ethics of translation where confidentiality is important.), Specialised (Terminology), From (your daily experience of language usage), you (must have noticed that different areas of specialisation use specialised terminology in their work. These include science), agricultur (e), economic (s), la (w), religio (n), medicin (e), biolog (y), linguistic (s), et (cetera. As a translator), one (may be asked to translate texts from specialised disciplines. In this case), one (needs to be well equipped with the vocabulary and meanings of the source text. And when translating the specialised terminology), there (is need to keep it specialised in the receptor language. So), the (translator needs to be precise and economical), at (the same time relaying the original meaning of the term.), The (major problem arises when the terms to be translated are abstract in nature and are objects. For example), if (a translator is given the following economics terms as extracted from Basic Economics for East Africa by Ddumba (2004), the (likely equivalents in Runyankore-Rukiga identified for translation are as follows: a), the (meaning is not as close to L1 as it should be. Ebirungi is basically \"good things\" and this is not the exact equivalent of \"advantages\". Another term would be ebirikuganyurwamu), from (the verb okuganyurwa), which (means payment for what you have done. The payment can either be monetary or benefits out of the activity. b), it (does not come out in a natural way. Economics), when (translated as ebyobutungi becomes synonymous with wealth), which (is obutungi or eitungo. The term \"economics\" comes from Greek for oikos (house), hence (\"rules of the house(hold), tunga (] that could be explained to mean 'to get'. In Runyankore-Rukiga), the (noun derived from okutunga is obutungi or eitungo), which (is ownership of assets both movable and immovable. This form of wealth is for either an individual or a group of people or a country. Judging from the origin of the word economics), obutungi (is more informative and extensive. A challenge), howeve (r), emerges (between resources and economics where the two are polysymous in RunyankoreRukiga and the meaning is almost the same. c), this (would literally mean 'the user' not 'the consumer'), but (it is the only word that has the nearest meaning. 'Consume'), in (Ry/Rk would be okurya which is similar to 'eating' but the word consumer), which (WebFinance Inc. defines as 'An individual who buys products or services for personal use and not for manufacture or resale' would contradict it since okurya), which (in this case would be omuri has no relationship with consumption of services. Omukozesa still remains with another challenge as it may also refer to the one who has used something to do a particular work. A noun that would be used and fits well by embodying the consumption of goods and services is not available in the language. This would make the word being translated according to the context), and (would not have a uniform translation), not (even its immediate equivalent. d), it (is not possible to differentiate the two especially when they are serving the same purpose. Form and content do not change at all), as (both remain nouns. e), 'micro' (does not have an equivalent term. It can best be translated as akakye. However), this (does not suit the term as akakye is translated as 'small'. Akakye is not a prefix but an independent adjective. Likewise), 'macro' (does not also have an equivalent but can be translated as ekihango. This), howeve (r), does (not also suit the term. f), the (term is used to refer to a situation of dire need. However), further (description of poverty in Economics brings about concepts such as 'relative poverty' and 'absolute poverty'. Relative poverty does not have an equivalent and there would be a problem translating it. Its closest translation is obworo obutarengyesereize. This translation does not sound natural. On the other hand), 'absolute (poverty'), which (is a noun phrase), has (an equivalent in form of obukyene. This is just a noun. g), they (are homophones. Both can be translated as ebintu. However), the (products), and (goods have a monetary attachment to them and can be disposed of at any time while ebintu may not always attract a price tag on them.

A case study on translation in Uganda that was conducted on the translation of fiction books from 2001 to 2008 showed that:), Translation (of Fiction Books from nine Ugandan publishers from 2001-2008), Source (: Adapted from MA thesis findings (Lapajian), although (we consider access to translated information as a motor of development), translation (in itself as a feature is a rare phenomenon in Uganda), if (we are to go by the findings on fiction books.

The relatively high proportion of fiction books translated into Ugandan languages can be explained in terms of the newly introduced education policy requiring the use of indigenous languages as media of instruction in the early classes. Hence), the (translations into Ugandan languages are for the most part translations of English school readers into Luganda), Runyankore (Rukiga and Ateso (Lapajian), thus (driving up the ratios of both English as a source language and Ugandan languages as target languages. The lesson to pick from this study is that the more the national and regional language policies go beyond discussions and speeches and get into practical application), the (better it will be for the growth of translation studies in Runyakitara.), Such (suggestions on best practices to adopt for the future are best analysed when one knows the history of a discipline. The preceding chapter traced the history of Bible translation in Uganda as one of the beginnings of translation in Runyakitara. How does this link up with the global history of translation?), Translation (and Interpretation: A Historical Perspective), Contemporary (scholars in translation studies like), George (Steiner), have (now become more specific on the history of translation by distinguishing the discipline from the history of language. George Steiner (1975), The (first period refers to the time of the great Roman translators like Horace and extends for 1), The (second period dates from the 1900s to the 1940s), The (third one extends from the 1950s to the 1960s), an (d), The (fourth one dates from the 1960s to 2000), The (fifth period from 2000 to the present), The (First Period in the History of Translation), This (period), according (to the scholar As-Safi (2011), from (the University of Petra), starts (with the Romans translators but should extend to ancient translated documents that have been found in Egypt and Iraq. This period was specifically documented in Fraser Tyler's essay on the \"Principles of Translation\" in 1791 and it is the longest in translation history. It is characterised by its word-for-word and sense-for-sense translations. It emphasises the aesthetic criteria of the target language (TL), warn (against the \"over-cautious imitation of the source model and slavish literalism\" (cited in As-Safi), From (the above discussions), Tyler (deduces three laws that are characteristic of this first period:), The (translations should give a complete transcript of the ideas of the original work), The (style and manner of writing should be of the same character with that of the original work), The (translation should have all the ease of the original composition (Cited in As-Safi), The (Second Period), This (period), according (to Steiner (1975), runs (up to the forties of the twentieth century. It is characterised by the focus on the theory of hermeneutic inquiry (from the Greek - to understand), The (translator must fully understand the sense and meaning of the original author), The (translator should have perfect knowledge of the both the source language (SL), The (translator should avoid word-for-word renderings), The (translator should use forms of speech in common use), The (translator's words should choose and order appropriately words to produce the correct tone. These five principles were further summarized by John Dryden (1631-1700), Meta (phrase), or (turning on an author word-by-word), and (line-by-line), from (one language to another), Paraphrase (or a translation with latitude), the (Cicerian \"sense for sense\" view of translation), Imitatio (n), where (the translator can abandon the text of the original as he sees fit), The (Third Period), This (is the shortest of all the periods in translation history. It starts with the first papers on machine translation in the 1940s and extends for less than three decades. It is characterised by the introduction of structural and applied linguistics as well as contrastive studies in morphology and syntax. These new studies help the translator to \"identify similarities and differences between native language (NL), in (As-Safi), pp (. 297-413), The (Fourth Period), This (period has its beginning in the 1960s and according to Steiner), it (is still running up to the present date. It is characterised by the translator's recourse to the use of hermeneutic inquiry in translating and interpreting. Translators in this period revised their approaches in order to include other disciplines in translation.), This (contemporary period has witnessed the emergence of a lot of new theories such as \"polysystem theory\"), from (a group of Russian literary theorists), offering (a general model for understanding), analysing (and describing the functions and evolution of literary systems and its application to the study of translated literature. The period also includes the \"skopos theory\" (from Greek purpose), reflecting (a shift from mainly linguistic theories to a more functionality and socioculturally oriented conceptualisation of translation.), Unlike (the preceding periods where one school of thought was pronounced), in (this contemporary period we notice the diversification of the theorists' orientation.

This fifth period also coexisted with the fourth since advanced work by translation), theorist (s), linguist (s), engineer (s), researcher (s), evaluators (of end-user groups), professional (translators), trainers (and translation companies started to bear fruits in the 1940s. From that time), improvement (of automatic machine translation of source text (ST), computerised (translation has advanced to \"rule based approaches\" (rules of transfer for the particular pair of languages being handled), The (early Runyakitara translations were mainly from the third and fourth period in the history of translation and as noted in the introduction), these (were unfortunately not many. But the fifth period which is bringing with it a lot of open source materials and virtually translated \"documents\" is fast increasing space for minorities in the translation world. This is increasing the hopes of the unheard and \"untranslated\" voices.), Translation (Theories), From (the existing literature), for (almost two thousand years), translation (theory had been merely concentrating on outstanding translated works of art. The science of translation), earlier (on known as \"translatology\"), did (not emerge until the 1940s (AsSafi), howeve (r), the (history of translation deals with: \"what translators say about their art/craft at different periods: what kinds of recommendations translators have made and how translation science has been taught\" (Baker), Translation (theory is of importance to translators because it helps them to determine the appropriate translation method for the text or text-category in question. It is also important in providing \"a framework of principles), restricted (rules and hints for translating texts and criticising translations), a (background for problem solving\" (As-Safi), A (rigorous theory of translation), in (the case of Runyakitara), provides (a practical evaluation procedure), with (specific criteria), which (indicates a certain level of accomplishment of the task under study. Eugene Nida (1976), there (is a sense in which any and all theories of translation are linguistic\" (Nida), p (. 66), He (goes on to classify these theories into three sub-categories which we will use in our analysis: philological theories), linguistic (theories), and (socio-linguistic theories. This classification depends upon the perspectives and approaches applied to the principles and procedures of translation discussed in the preceding chapter.), Philological (Theories), These (rely on philology as the study of the development of language), a (concept linked to the classical literary studies (As-Sifa), they (will be mainly concerned with the comparisons of Runyakitara structures and those of other indigenous and foreign languages into which one is translating or interpreting. They will dwell on the functional correspondence), literary (genre), stylistics (and rhetoric.

In the words of Munday (2001), p (. 16), going (towards the consideration of the communicative purpose of translation\". Nord (2007), p (. 8), under (this perspective is uplifted \"to a form of mediated intercultural communication\".), The (Socio-linguistic Theories), These (theories), according (to As-Safi (2011), endeavour (to link translation to the communicative theory and the information theory with a special emphasis on the receptor's role in the translation process. We hasten to add that the sociolinguistic theories do not disband language structures), but (rather), deal (with them at a higher level), in (accordance to their functions in the communication process. These structures may include rhetorical devices), or (figures of speech such as simile), metapho (r), iron (y), hyperbol (e), etc (. These theories require the translator to exhibit a high level of language performance.), The (Interpretative Theory), The (interpretative theory is also known as the theory of sense and is part of the socio-linguistic theories. Originally), it (was designed to reflect the process involved in conference interpretation. The proponents of this theory argue that: ... interpreters do not work merely with linguistic meaning), but (also need to take into account such factors as the cognitive context of what has already), been (said), the (setting in which the interpreting is taking place and the interpreter's own world knowledge\" (Lavault), cited (in Shuttlewoth & Cowrie), p (. 85), The (focus), in (this case of interpretation), is (on the intended meaning), or (the sense), than (the words of the speaker on the floor), which (is the oral source text. We note also that the target text that is relayed to the receptor in the interpretation process is also in the oral form.), The (Systems Theory), It (promotes a general model for understanding), analysing (and describing the functioning and evolution of literary systems with special emphasis on the study of translated literature. Followers of this theory give priority to the requirements of the target language), stressing (readability and accessibility), employing (a pleasant and easy style. An example of the systems' theory is Baker's polysystem theory.), The (Manipulation Theory), This (is also associated with the translation of literature. According to Hermans), under (this theory), translation (implies a degree of manipulation of the ST for a certain purpose), because (its process aligns \"the target text (TT), target (oriented), functional (and systemic\" (Hermans 1985), p (. 11), this (one approaches translation not as science), but (rather as an art which permits manipulation rather than rigid equivalences. Accordingly), translation (is deemed a \"re-writing process and the translator a re-writer who can alter or manipulate the ST in such a way as to be acceptable in the target language and culture\" (As-Safi), p (. 41), The (Aesthetic Communication Theory), This (theory propounds the creativity-orientation), especially (for literature), which (is essentially an aesthetic communication between the translator and the target reader. This theory caters for the arousing of the reader's suspense), interest (and pleasure. To this end), according (to As-Safi), a (highly elevated style and literary diction\" (Steiner), in (As-Safi), pp (. 297-413), The (Relevancy Theory), This (is associated with pragmatics which deals with the use of language in communication. More specifically), it (deals with the way meaning is conveyed and manipulated by the participants in a communicative situation. In other words), pragmatics (deals with the speaker's meaning and the way it is interpreted by the hearers through what is known as \"implicature\". The theory emphasizes \"the interpretative), use (of language as distinct from the descriptive use\" (Palumbo), cited (by Allot 2003), p (. 51), Baker (2005), points (out that human communication is based on the ability of human beings to infer what is meant that may be accounted for through the principle of relevance), defined (as achieving maximum benefit at minimum processing cost. The relevance theory tries to account for the way the information processing faculties of the mind enable us to communicate with one another. \"Its domain is therefore with the mental faculties rather than texts or processes of text production\" (Gutt), p (. 21), From (the foregoing), one (can observe that each translation theory has its way of trying to balance the semantic content and the literary values of the original text. They represent sets of options for assessing whether the right word was chosen or the appropriate modification was effected. The correct application of these theories on Runyakitara consists of mastering the art of choosing the appropriate set of options available for a multi-dimensional assessment of the processes and product of translation.), Translation (and Interpretation Strategies), The (preceding sections dealt with the theoretical base of translation and how it has evolved with the science of language and communication. This section links the science and art of translation to the strategies adopted for the different text types. From the onset), it (is noted that some scholars of interpretation refer to strategies as techniques or methods of translation. In this chapter), a (strategy of translation is considered like a procedure that helps to solve a problem encountered in translating a text or its segment (Baker), when (one is translating), a (strategy or technique needs to be selected to tap into the translator's background knowledge), his (/her awareness of the register), conten (t), the (relevant linguistic conventions and his/her mastery of the language. Below are some strategies that can be used for tackling different text types or dealing with a specific function/purpose of translation.), Domestication (Strategy), It (is also known as \"normalisation [or] naturalisation strategy\". It is useful in \"bridging gaps and achieving intelligibility in line with the hermeneutic approach which focuses on interpretation and grants the translator the right to manipulate the text so as to make it natural), comprehensible (and readable\" (Steiner), in (As-Safi), pp (. 297-413), This (strategy is often adopted by liberal translators as seen in the following translation of proverbs from Runyankore:), Tingasiga (tasiga ntoni The drunkard never misses hard fist knocks (Interpretation: If you keep going to every bar where alcohol is), you (will not miss getting a hard fist knock because where alcohol is), the (chances of fighting are high), Mpora (mpora ekahisya oтиnyongororwa aha iziba), Slow (steps led the earthworm to the well (Interpretation: Hard tasks are accomplished by taking the first step), Compensation (Strategy), This (concerns the technique of making up for the translation loss of significant features of the source text (ST), politica (l), scientific (and technical texts where translation loss is anticipated), compensation (has been frequently utilised to make up for that loss. In the texts that have translated the analysis of the Rwanda genocide), for (instance Taylor (1999), although (the direct meaning of \"interahamwe\" was known to be \"those who work together\"), the (terminology has been left in Kinyarwanda), with (a supplement of \"Interahamwe militia\" to give the political connotation of their military orientation.), Elaboration (and Explication Strategy), In (order to communicate the message in the ST when the translator cannot find the exact equivalence), she (or he may resort to the elaboration or explanation of the segment (As-Sifa), metaphors (and technical terminologies), as (shown below:), Preterm (labour (after 20 weeks), but (before 37 weeks), Pre (eclampsia/eclampsia), severe (headache), blurred (vision), loss (of consciousness), Kuteerwa (emiyaga), n'omutwe (gw'amani), okaba (nk'ayahuma), okagwa (akama), In (the translation cited above), the (technical segments from women's reproductive medical terminologies were best translated by elaboration and explication where an equivalent name of the health status or disease was not readily available in Runyankore.), Approximation (and Compromise Strategy), This (strategy tries to create a balance between the SL aesthetic and cultural values which are acceptable or unacceptable in the TL. The difficulty with discretional approximation though has achieved \"an equilibrium whereby the original aesthetic flavour is transferred into English without hindering genuine comprehension or producing something that can be rejected as totally un-English\" (As-Safi), Equation (and Substitution), Using (the words of Malone (2013), where (equality would seem absolute\". We now talk of going on \"safari\" using the \"kompyuta\" in Runyakitara and putting on \"Busuti\" like the Baganda and when you visit an Atesot friend you will drink their brew \"ajono\" and play \"omweso\". These events), dresse (s), food (s), and (sports have now become a familiar part of our daily life because of intercultural living and social proximity. However), Malone (2013), p (. 1), that (\"), The (second form of equation is provided by the \"calque\"), where (the target language adapts the source language term to its own morpho-phonological framework. The Runyankore \"okupaminga\" term for \"perming hair\" or \"kalituusi\" for eucalyptus have been accepted as common usage. Another example is the shout of acclaim \"Encore!\" from French in musical concerts in Uganda), which (is dressed to cover the complexities of gender), plural (and politeness markers that would otherwise be needed if another translation strategy was chosen for requesting a repeat.), One (of the most common risks associated with the word-for-word equation is that of false cognates (false friends), where (the meanings of deceptively similar terms do not match across languages. The classic examples in Runyakore and Luganda are okushitama/okusitama), To (return to Malone's (2013), the (antithesis of equation is substitution), adopted (when there is no direct equivalence. For example), at (a purely grammatical level), the (Rutooro prepositional phrase replaces (substitutes), the (proverb Atariho tagwerwa muti), in (French is replaced by Les retardatires mangent les os [Literally: Late comers eat bones]. At the beginning of the Walt Disney Pictures version of 'Alice in Wonderland' (1951), Alice (is given a song to sing), 'all (about cats and rabbits'. If the film was to be done and Alice was to sing in Runyakitara), another (simple and silly song would be chosen. The reasons for such changes are not merely linguistic or merely cultural relocation), but (linguistic fidelity that can be rejected in the interest of a greater good), for (the entertainment of children (Malone), Divergence (and Convergence), The (strategy of divergence focuses on choosing a suitable term from a potential range of alternatives. \"A road\" in Runyankore could be rendered by omuhanda), or (oruguudo), while (\"to take\" can be translated as \"okutwara\" or \"okwihaho\". Divergence represents a relationship of one-to-many. \"Okuhindura\"), for (instance), could (mean to change), to (exchange), to (turn), or (even), to (translate. Where there is a whole set of possibilities), the (translator's aim is to make the right choice. Convergence), on (the other hand), represents (a relationship of many-to-one. It is the opposite of Divergence. We could cite the case of French pronouns \"Tu), T (e), To (i), Vous (\" that all would converge into \"You\" when translating into English.), Amplification (and Reduction), Amplification (requires the translator to add some element to the source text so as to improve comprehensibility. The most frequent form of amplification is the translator's note), be (it in form of an endnote), or (footnote or a parenthesis following the item in question. Sometimes), a (single lexical item in one language needs a 'collocational' partner in the other. Certain components may be cultural), semanti (c), linguisti (c), or (a mixture of all. The amplification device is also found in technical translation in order to aid comprehension.), Reductio (n), as (the term suggests), consists (of omitting elements in a target text because they are redundant or even misleading. Thus), the ('blackboard' in Runyankore becomes merely orubaaho and a 'folktale' is ekigano.), Diffusion (and Condensation), A (source text item is expanded without adding any extra layer of meaning), that (is), it (provides more or less elaboration in the target language. In Runyankore), a (sentence which ends with shinta expresses a lot of doubt or fear or mistrust in the person who is the subject.), Yaagira (ngu naabireeta! shinta!), He (said he will bring them! I highly doubt it.), In (the case of condensation), a (source text is contracted without omitting any layer of meaning (Melone), Ekintu (ky'omuhendo gw'ahansi = cheap), Kushara (emihendo), In (the other direction), prepositional (verbs and phrasal verbs are typical of this phenomenon:), To (do make up = okwesiiga To make up your mind = okusharaho To be obliged to have recourse to), Re (ordering), The (strategy of re-ordering), is (within the field of comparative syntax. At its simplest), it (requires the translator to operate basic inversion procedures with), for (example), the (adjective-noun sequences: white horse / embaraasi erikwera), and (the verb-object positioning: Ninkukunda / I love you.), Set (collocations of two or more items exist in both languages:), okufa (n'okukira / life and death), ekiine (ebirikwera n'okwiragura/ black and white), ahagati (y'amaino ga rufu n'ekituuro / (between), The (foregoing examples indicate how such pairings can sometimes match perfectly or match partly but belong very definitely in the same semantic field), and (match perfectly but in an inverted form.), The (very frequent use of the passive voice in English creates another need for re-ordering in translating into Runyakitara since it has:), its (own identical passive forms), e (.g.), Abantu (boona nibamukunda / He is loved by everyone), an (active form using verbs with impersonal agents whose nominal or pronominal identity never appears), e (.g. Tibakakingambiraga I have never been told that/They have never told it to me.), He (is being interrogated), it (becomes clear that a thorough mastery of the lexico-grammar of the source language and the target language is indispensable for a translator.), Interpreting (Strategies), In (the preceding sections we have been looking at translation as a means of transferring values and the creation of equivalents through the written text. Interpretation deals with a similar process and product but orally. The two terms), are (NOT interchangeable), as (the general public tends to suggest. Interpretation is much more demanding than translation in terms of competences required.), The (major requirements for a competent translator could be summarised as the mastery of SL and TL), thorough (knowledge of source and target cultures), familiarity (with the topic/register), vocabulary (wealth), and (awareness of the three-phase process: SL decoding), trans (coding or SL-TL transfer), and (TL encoding (As-Safi), on (the other hand), requires (at least five more skills: short-term memory for storage and retrieval), acquaintance (with prosodic features and different accents), quick (thinking and paying full attention), and (self-composure. For consecutive interpretation which is done segment by segment), with (pauses in between), the (interpreter requires in addition), the (knowledge of shorthand writing skills.), Compensation (Strategy in Interpreting), Unlike (the translator who enjoys the availability of time and resources), the (interpreter has to work rapidly so as to keep up with the natural speaking speed of the floor language (speech of the orator), working (out the sense equivalent and listening. The maximum acceptable relay-delay is 30 seconds after the floor language. The interpreter is therefore), often (obliged to resort to compensation strategies in order to ease the burdens of constraint), achieve (a smooth performance), maintain (a fluidity of ideas and improve the pace of delivery. In this speech where the orator was making a list of the agricultural products of Mali), the (interpreter compensated for the last item as it was unfamiliar to the Ugandan audience:), le (mais), les (haricots), le (millet), et (noix d'acajous), maiz (e), bean (s), ric (e), millet (and other grain crops.), Syntactic (Modification Strategy), To (eliminate or reduce delays and to counter the risk of lagging behind the SL speaker), the (interpreter starts simultaneously uttering before he perceives the whole idea. This entails carrying out certain syntactic adjustments. For example), in (interpreting from English into Runyankore), the (interpreter can start the sentence with the subject), add (a nominal clause to attribute the action and end with a verbal phrase. By doing so), she (/he could reduce the time required to wait until the speaker utters the verb that might follow a long noun phrase with sometimes embedded phrases and clauses. For example:), Focus (on Africa), t (h), t (h), Dec (2013), ba (Minista b'Enshonga ez'Aheeru ab' Ekigombe ky'Ebyentunguuka n'Okwerinda Ekyanda (IGADD), hati (bari omu rukiiko Juba kuteesa n'abeebembezi b'Ebibiina ebirikurwanirira okurekyera aho orutaro reeru bakaza omu kigaaniro ky'okukoragana omuri eryo ihanga\" (Translated by Natukunda-Togboa), Segmenting (and Chunking Strategy), The (interpreter can resort to this strategy when the SL speaker utters a lengthy sentence which has to be 'sliced' into sense-units so as to cope with the short-term memory (As-Safi), she (/he may combine short sentences into a compound one for coherence in delivery.), Lining (up or Queuing Strategy), In (order to reduce the constraint of time-lag), the (interpreter may delay rendering a less significant information segment amidst a heavy load period of piled up information and then catch up in any lulls that occur later. It should be noted however), that (the delayed segment may not be cohesively compatible with the flow of delivery and may thus disrupt the thematic progression (El-Shiyab & Hussien), Calquing (Strategy), This (is another strategy used to mitigate the effects of time constraints and to avert any anticipated lexical difficulty. The interpreter may imitate the SL lexical patterns and collocations and hence produce a literal), 'verbatim' (rendition. An example of this is when frequently African proverbs and sayings are introduced 'verbatim' in political speeches:), Nimbagambira (nti), I (am telling you), Paraphrasing (Strategy), Conversel (y), the (interpreter may resort to paraphrase in encountering a SL culturespecificity), hence (it may be rightly called \"Exegetic Strategy\". For the same sentence above she/he may choose to say:), Indee (d), Approximation (Strategy), Due (to speed constraint), when (the interpreter does not find a direct TL equivalent or fails to remember it), she (/he can produce an alternative that has common semantic features. For instance), opium (poppy could be approximated to \"enjaayi\" (marijuana), Borrowing (Strategy), To (cope with the speaker and maintain a rapid pace of delivery), the (interpreter may have recourse to loan words through transliteration. Most frequently), this (is done for technical terms like video), stadiu (m), cinem (a), IGAD (D), UNESC (O), boda (boda.), Ellipsis (Strategy), This (is an economising strategy where some SL words are deleted when they are believed to be superfluous), repetitive (or redundant), e (.g. (I will), the (lecturer/instructor can actually pick and demonstrate strategies that can be used to overcome syntactic and semantic constraints), those (for solving phonological), prosodic (and phatic problems), and (those to tackle paralinguistic and psychological constraints like tract and stage fear. In general), howeve (r), constant (detailed reading assists the interpreter to familiarise with content and register), and (to deal with the preliminary linguistic constraints. Other issues concerning accents), intonatio (n), pitc (h), rhythm (and tempo get to be solved as the practionner gets more accustomed to the profession. Indeed), as (As-Safi (2011), p (. 39), in (the final analysis \"translating/interpreting is an intercultural communication act that requires bicultural competence\".), Audio (Visual Translation), I (have decided to end this chapter with a section on audio-visual translation because it seems to me to be a new area that is technically located midway between translation and interpretation. Yet it is a field which is attracting a lot of media attention as it is a fashionable channel of popularising Runyakitara using the new digital technologies and social-media networks.), The (advent of digital technology), especially (the mass production of DVDs in Third World Countries like Uganda), has (meant an increase in films), television (programmes which are mostly in English), frequently (with subtitles. But there are increasingly those with a diagonal (different language), the (term used for the interpretation played over the DVD orally), is (\"dubbing\" (Ghaemi & Benyamin), a (translation method which makes use of the acoustic channels), as (recognised by Baker), and (Hochel (1998), p (. 74), Subtitling (is defined as \"supplementing the original sound track with another voice), in (another language\". Similarly), audio (visual transfer denotes \"the process by which a film or television programme is made comprehensible to a target audience who is unfamiliar with the original source\" (Ghaemi & Benyamin), p (. 40), these (are processes which involve literary and figurative translation and interpretation. According to Gottlieb (1998 cited in Schwarz 2003), pp (. 5-6), a (subtitler is faced with formal (quantitative), whereas (formal constraints are the space factors (a maximum of 2 lines and 35 characters), p (. 5), both (require a reduction of the text.\"), In (terms of benefits), scholars (have demonstrated that), there (are some advantages for watching subtitled language programmes. First), watching (subtitled programmes fosters the practice of the language of the screen translation or interpretation. Secondly), such (programmes can improve reading skills), in (this case in Runyakitara. However), these (benefits only apply if the subtitles meet the quality requirements. Pushing further Gottlieb's findings (2004), one (can deduce that interlingual subtitling), which (encompasses societal and language-political implications), is (instrumental in improving reading skills), boosting (language competences), facilitating (easy and cheap intercultural exchange. Gottlieb goes on to propose the following translation strategies for subtitling films:), Expansion (is used when the original text requires an explanation because of some cultural nuance not retrievable in the target language.), Paraphrase (is resorted to in cases where the phraseology of the original cannot be reconstructed in the same syntactic way in the target language.), Transfer (refers to the strategy of translating the source text completely and accurately.), Imitation (maintains the same forms), typically (with names of people and places.), Transcription (is used in those cases where a term is unusual even in the source text), for (example), the (use of a third language or nonsense language.), Dislocation (is adopted when the original employs some sort of special effect), e (.g.), a (silly song in a cartoon film where the translation of the effect is more important than the content.), Condensation (would seem to be the typical strategy used), that (is), the (shortening of the text in the least obtrusive way possible.), Decimation (is an extreme form of condensation where perhaps for reasons of discourse speed), even (potentially important elements are omitted.), Deletion (refers to the total elimination of parts of a text.), Resignation (describes the strategy adopted when no translation solution can be found and meaning is inevitably lost (Ghaemi & Benyamin), is (the \"lack of responsible institutions and educated professional subtitlers at work\" (Ghaemi & Benyamin), p (. 39), most (DVDs are subtitled using special software intended to exclude human interference. In situations where the technology is well developed), the (quality of the translation is good. But in Uganda), where (the subtitling in Runyakitara is mostly effected on pirated DVDs), using (back street make-shift \"studios\"), there (is hardly any standard to be respected. Our interest in the present publication is to call on universities and other tertiary institutions to include the study of subtitling in translation and interpretation studies), so (that professionals can be trained for such work. Educated subtitlers will not come into the realm of film), music (and entertainment industry as long as screen translators and interpreters remain in the backstreet shadows hiding from law enforcement agents. They need to be recognized for their creative contribution to the image and sound productions and to be included in the curriculum of translation and interpretation studies.), Conclusio (n), In (conclusion to this chapter), we (can observe that theoretical discussions on translation and interpretation are important because they widen the practitioners' and learners' 'perspective' for the use of systematic strategies in the translation and interpretation of texts. In terms of linking theory to practice in this chapter), the (insights of Bassnett (2002), to (set the scholar against the practitioner as happened in other disciplines), would (be tragic indeed\" (Bassnett), p (. 17), the (different theories that have been advanced and the strategies that have been proposed are crucial to training in translation and interpretation in Runyakitara. In the chapter), we (have also illustrated how new areas in the discipline), like (audio-visual translation and screen interpretation), which (hitherto have not received serious attention), can (bring forth economic), linguistic (and socio-cultural benefits if they are promoted and formally incorporated in translation and interpretation studies.), Reference (s), Allo (t), N (.

In other words), orthography (is the system of representing the sounds of words by written symbols (Fromkin et al.), punctuated (and capitalized. Runyakitara), like (any other human language), manifests (itself in two forms: spoken and written. In the opinion of Fromkin and his colleagues (2003), these (two forms are distinct in the following ways:), The (spoken language is the natural form of language while the written language is artificial. By referring to the spoken language as being natural), it (means that it is innate (inborn), that (child will have the ability to communicate in that spoken medium. There is therefore), no (teacher or instructor required to teach a child his/her mother tongue. On the other hand), written (language is artificial because those who know it have to learn it in order to communicate using it. Written language is therefore), an (invention of man that helps him to store information and disseminate it.), Secondl (y), written (language is not the original form of language. This is because it is a representation of the spoken form where human vocal symbols made by speech organs are represented on a piece of paper by graphic symbols. Because of that), it (is impossible to find a written language which is not spoken), although (it is possible to find a spoken language that is not written), especially (if that language's orthography has not been developed.), Thirdl (y), although (a written language changes over time because the process of change is very slow), the (spoken language easily changes. The written form of language is more conservative and resistant to change than the spoken form. Therefore), a (written word is not only more permanent than a spoken one but is also rarely subjected to linguistic changes.), Fourthl (y), in (a written language), the (user has a relatively wider range of graphic symbols which she/he uses. For example), there (are more than 12 vowel sounds that), are (represented by only five vowels), and (u. Written language is also uniform with all varieties of dialects of a language), for (example), while (the American English pronunciation is different from that of the British), the (two forms do not significantly differ in spelling. This is not the case with the spoken form.), Finall (y), spoken (language cannot be informative per se mainly due to repetitions. This is because the spoken language does not have to follow the rules of grammar while the written language follows the rules as specified.), Principles (of a good orthography), Fromkin (et al. (2003), the (reader is faced with a problem of guessing the meaning of the word. The orthography of Runyakitara has followed this principle as most sounds are represented by one symbol. The problem is on homonyms where more than two words are represented by one sound.), A (good orthography of a language should be consistent), there (should be no contradictions within the system. This means that: a), This (is one of the principles that Runyakitara orthography adhered to. There are no two sounds that are represented by the same symbol), The (third principle is that a good orthography should be convenient to the extent that it is easy to write and symbols are easy to make. The symbols are also easy to print and type.), Another (principle of a good orthography is that it should conform to the orthography of the other languages in the region. It is not good for the orthography of a language to differ much with that of its neighbours. In the case of Runyakitara), the (orthography conforms to all the neighbouring languages as they all use alphabetic writing system.), The (last principle of a good orthography is that it should be acceptable to the people who are going to use it. Often), people (have strong opinions especially if there has already been an older orthography in use. Time must be taken to consult local opinion and to explain carefully the reasons for any proposed change. This was), done (in 1954 where disagreements emerged and Runyoro-Rutooro ended up writing their own and another conference was organised for Runyankore-Rukiga that got her orthography in 1964.), The (Need for Writing Uganda Indigenous Languages), The (history of writing dates as far back as 3000 BC when the Egyptians developed hieroglyphic writing for recording events in their lives. Although many languages all over the world have been written), there (are still many African languages are not yet written.), In (Uganda), there (are about 15 languages that are not yet written. The main question is), why (do we need to write our languages? There are several reasons for that. These include the following:), Preservation (of Information), For (many traditional societies), the (major form of transmission and preservation of information is by word of mouth (oral transmission), this (method has proved very inadequate because as the information is passed from one source to another), it (undergoes considerable transformations. In some instances), more (information is added while in others), it (is reduced or adulterated. Consequently), by (the time the message gets to the intended recipient), it (is no longer in its original form.), Furthermor (e), for (purposes of preservation of information), sometimes (the only source of information might die without leaving any recording of his or her knowledge behind. Such occurrences confirm the West African saying that \"when an elder dies), a (library burns\". Therefore), with (such poor record-keeping methods), it (is imperative that we write our languages.), Coverag (e), Whereas (the word of mouth needs face-to-face interaction and can only serve those people who are physically present), the (written word can even be received by those who are not physically present. True), with (modern technology), tape (recorded information and radio transmissions can cover a wider distance but given our Ugandan standard of living), few (people can afford to buy radios and maintain their running as well.), Furthermor (e), the (radio has a schedule which the listener must follow. If he tunes at a wrong time), he (/she will miss the programme. Yet with written material), it (can be read at the recipient's will and can be referred to anytime one wants.), Educatio (n), The (most important factor with written materials is that people can be availed with education materials which can help them improve their lives. These written materials are of various disciplines and can be used for both academic and non-academic purposes), and (may remain relevant for a long time. For instance), books (on hygiene that), were (written in 1935 by the White Fathers Mission are still relevant and can be utilized to date to educate people on how they can improve their hygiene.), With (the availability of written materials in various fields in Ugandan indigenous languages), Ugandans (can understand developmental issues better and participate meaningfully in their governance. For example), the (provision of HIV prevention information in the local languages has created substantial awareness about HIV prevention and transmission among Ugandans.), Preservation (of a language), A (language can best be preserved if it is written. When a language is unwritten), many (indigenous words are lost while it is not easy to document words that have been incorporated. It is difficult to preserve a language in its oral form.), Cultural (preservation), Culture (can best be preserved if it is written. Norms), role (s), sanction (s), beliefs (and customs are easy to pass on from one generation to another if the culture of a specified language is written. However), with (the ever-increasing socio-economic changes), it (is easy to lose important components of culture), if (it is not documented.), Historical (Developments in the Orthography of Runyakitara), It (should be noted that at the end of the), t (h), Century (and during the early years of the), t (h), Centur (y), practically (all the indigenous reading materials available in Uganda were in Luganda. At that time), it (was even thought that Luganda would be the major language of communication and instruction throughout the region.), Howeve (r), the (reality was that very few people understood Luganda in the whole of Western Uganda at that time. Furthermore), with (the consolidation of the reinstated monarchy in Tooro (reinstated by the British in 1891), it (was felt more and more that Luganda should be replaced by Rutooro and Runyoro as the major language for communication in the two kingdoms respectively.), The (writing of Runyakitara (Rubongoya), started (with the Runyoro-Rutooro dialects before it spread to Runyankore-Rukiga. The Protestant Missionaries of the Church Missionary Society (CMS), around (1900. The same author produced the first grammar of the language in 1902 called An Elementary Lunyoro Grammar which was based on the Runyamwenge (essentially using the Runyamwenge sub-dialect of Rutooro), als (o), based (on Runyamwenge dialect. The first bible was used in the whole of Western Region and some areas of the present-day Democratic Republic of Congo.), Other (books were subsequently written by both the CMS missionaries and the RCM (Roman Catholic Missionaries), Some (written work also appeared during the early years in Runyankore), e (.g Omuntu na Hygiene published by the White Fathers Mission), Mbarara (in 1935 and was intended for primary schools. The full translated version of the bible in RunyankoreRukiga came out in the 1950s.), Efforts (to Standardise the Orthography of Runyakitara), It (was), according (to Rubongoya (1965), R (. A. Snoxall), the (then Acting Director of Education), who (in 1946), after (consultations with A. N. Tucker), an (expert on Bantu languages at the School of Oriental and African Studies), Londo (n), who (decided to introduce a new orthography. After discussions with missionaries and other educators in Buganda), the (new orthography was adopted for Luganda. That very year), Snoxall (organised another conference for the Western Region at Virika), Fort (Portal), to (discuss a standard orthography for the Runyoro language.), It (is in this conference that the representatives of Ankore and Kigezi stated categorically that their language was different from Runyoro and that accepting this new orthography would bring about the demise of their language which was already developing written materials. They added that the people in their areas were not prepared to read any book or newspaper written in Runyoro.), According (to Taylor (1960), the (Virika Conference therefore), broke (up without any decision being taken on the new orthography. However), from (this period), as (Betungura (1960), Runyankore (continued developing and came up with the first Runyankore-Rukiga orthography in a conference at Mbarara in 1954. This conference was chaired by Prof. A. N. Tucker and the secretary was K. S. M. Kikira. Thereafter), the (colonial authorities started recognizing its importance in Ankore and Kigezi. In 1947 for instance), the (Education Department of the Uganda Colonial Government authorized the use of Runyankore as a medium of instruction in Primary 1 and 2 in Ankore and Kigezi. This policy was clearly stated in the 1948 Education Report which recognized six vernaculars as media of instruction in Primary School. These were: Luganda), Lunyor (o), Lu (o), Ates (o), Lugbara (and Swahili.), The (Education Report (1948), but (noted that the use of Runyankore dialect of Runyoro had been conceded for the first two years of primary school in), Ankor (e), and (would continue to be used only up to that level until when there would be sufficient materials written in Runyankore.), This (policy remained valid until the Castle Report of 1963 when RunyankoreRukiga was recognized as one of the six major vernaculars to be used in the school system (Swahili had ceased being recognized as a vernacular in Uganda in 1956), Runyankore (Rukiga had developed considerably and by the 1970s), it (was somewhat in better position than Runyoro-Rutooro.), After (the break-up of the Virika meeting of 1946), the (Banyoro and Batooro reconvened in Hoima in 1952 (six years later), this (time for Runyoro and Rutooro), which (at this meeting had adopted the name Runyoro-Rutooro (rather than Runyoro), At (this meeting), the (harmonization work involved such aspects as taking a common stand particularly concerning some of the symbols and signs used by the CMS missionaries and those used by the RCM.), For (instance), while (CMS missionaries used the diacritic sign (-), the (RCM (White Fathers), it (was agreed that vowel length would be marked by two vowels. Some harmonization was also effected at the level of grammar to reflect the language usage of the Banyamwenge. We produce here some recommendations made at the Hoima meeting as reported by Rubongoya (1965), Many (of the recommendations made in fact reflected both orthography and language (grammatical), In (the elaboration of standard orthographies), the (authors were guided by the recommendations of the International Institute for African Languages and Culture which was formed in London in 1925. This later became The International African Institute.), One (of their pre-occupations was to elaborate workable orthographies in African languages. Because of the many sounds in African languages which did not exist in European languages), the (tendency had been to utilise diacritical marks such as (), below (or beside a given symbol so as to account for a given sound), e (.g.: the (-), For (these orthographies to be workable), the (Institute wanted), as (much as possible), to (have every sound represented by one symbol and to reduce to the minimum the use of diacritical signs or marks.), Their (work was somewhat simplified by what had already been done by the International Phonetic Association which was formed in Paris in 1886 and whose original name was L'Association Phonetique Internationale. This Association from its inception was made up of eminent linguists and phoneticians from various European countries such as Otto Jespensen from Denmark), Paul (Passy from France (Ferender), and (Henry Luncet from Britain.), One (of the major tasks of the Association was to identify all possible speech sounds as they exist in human languages. They then came out with the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), The (International African Institute also made its own alphabet known as the International African Alphabet (IAA), whereas (in the IPA), the (palatal nasal is usually written as /n/), in (the International African Alphabet it is written as /ny/. It is this latter alphabet that was the basis of the standardised orthographies of Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga.), Meanwhil (e), the (Banyankore and Bakiga who had broken away from the Runyoro-Rutooro orthography conference in 1946 organised their own orthography conference in Mbarara in 1954. The conference), which (was attended by prominent writers and religious leaders from Ankole and Kigezi), was (chaired by Professor A. N. Tucker. A report on standardisation of Runyankore-Rukiga orthography), which (was being worked out after the breakup of the Virika Conference was presented in this conference), discussed (and adopted with the necessary amendments and became the basis for the language's writing system. The rules of orthography adopted), according (to Taylor (1960), Current (Situation of the Orthography of Runyakitara), The (four dialects of Runyakitara (Runyankore-Rukiga and Runyoro-Rutooro), to (produce language scholars and researchers.), One (of the areas that needs serious consideration is orthography), because (a proper orthography of the language has not been reached despite several revisions. Currently), there (are five official versions of the orthography of the language), namely (: i), While (we may say that the five orthographies above are satisfactory to a certain extent), there (is still need for more revisions for purposes of standardisation. The orthographical gap that still exists is mostly along dialectical differences and improper linguistic arguments.), The (main principle of Runyakitara orthography is that words are written the way they are pronounced or the way one hears them. The writing system adopted follows the principles of a good orthography that include accuracy. In this standardised orthography), all (sounds are represented by symbols that do not leave any room for guesswork in pronunciation. The second principle followed is consistency where the same sound is represented by the same symbol with no silent letters. Convenience is the third principle that was followed. The symbols used to represent the sounds follow the alphabetic writing system. The fourth principle that was followed is conformity. The standardisation of this orthography ensured that it conforms to the orthography of other languages around the Runyakitara speaking area. The fifth principle is acceptability. Since the beginning of this writing system in 1954), it (has been fully accepted by the users as required in linguistics. Following the linguistic requirements), what (shall be considered as a unified standard Runyakitara orthography is as follows:), Double (Consonants), The (voiced bilabial plosive /b/ except when preceded by a nasal (nasal compound), this (usually occurs in loan and onomatopoeic words. The onomatopoeic words only exist in Runyoro-Rutooro as shown in the following examples:), On (the other hand), loan (words take on /bb/ in Runyoro-Rutooro and RunyankoreRukiga as indicated in the examples below:), In (Runyoro-Rutooro a /b/ at the beginning of a sentence can sometimes be pronounced either as fricative or as plosive. But in this latter case), a (single /b/ is used in spelling), for (example:), Baitu (omwana araha? Banura agenzire. Binu bintu ki? Baraatugamba ki? Buganda okarugayo di? But where is the child? Banura has gone. What are these? What will they say about us? When did you leave Buganda?), It (is recommended that Runyankore-Rukiga adopts the same rule where onomatopoeic and loan words pronounced with a plosive are concerned), for (example.:), When (an object is expressed followed by a verb stem starting with), the (nasal is doubled. Examples of words with), Rn (/Rt), Rn (/Rt akammanya ammigire alimmara araammamirira nibannuga bannigire he/she knew me he/she has squeezed me he/she will be sufficient for me he/she will spray me they look at me with disgust they have strangled me), As (a general rule), a (vowel that occurs before a double nasal is pronounced long. However), if (this lengthening of the vowel is predictable), it (is written as a single vowel), for (example: akammanya is pronounced akaamanya but it is written: akammanya.), When (a subject is expressed followed by a verb stem starting with a nasal), there (is doubling of the nasal), for (example:), Nasal (compounds), There (is another category of nasals that exists in Runyakitara. These are nasals that include the following:), Like (in the case of), they (are also predictable and wherever one meets them), there (is no need of writing a double vowel before them. Examples include the following:), In (Runyoro-Rutooro when), it (is written doubled), for (example:), Note (that if a double), there (is generally change in meaning), for (example:), Minimal (pair), It (should also be noted that if a vowel preceding double), a (double vowel should be written), for (example:), As (a general rule), the (long vowel before /rr/ is predictable. So), it (will be written as a single vowel), for (example:), Howeve (r), there (are cases), especially (with the word kurra (to weep or to cry), the (long vowel shall be repeated with a double vowel as in the following examples:), Amaiso (gange garra), Gaarra (sente zange 2. Abaana bange barra), Baarra (abaana sente zaabo 3. Kurra kintu kibi muno), Kuura (ebintu obireete kunu 4. Bunu obwana burra muno), Buurra (oyetegereze eki ngambire 5. Abakazi barra obu babiihirwa), My (eyes cry (ooze), Abakazi (baarra obunyansi ha bugenyi Women spread grass (on the ground), howeve (r), that (the above expression does not exist in minimal pairs. For example), in (amaiso garra), we (have the verb ku-rra while in gaarra sente zange), we (have the verb ku-garra. It is the same with all the other examples.

It may also be used to indicate that the expression which has been made is not clear. It is mainly used when a word that is interrogative in nature appears in a sentence. For example), N'oha (owaareeta ekitookye eki? [Ry/Rk] Who has brought this banana? Nookora ki? [Ry/Rk] What are you doing? N'ogu oizire nawe? [Rn/Rt] You have come also with this one? Interrogation in Runyakitara does not have specific words that determine it. This is because some words are purely interrogative while in certain times interrogation is determined by the intonation. This is strengthened by Mubangizi (1963), the (interrogation words do not appear but are only heard), seeking (confirmation. For example), Ogu (yaarya?), Has (this one eaten? Have you brought the children? Have you eaten? What has brought you? When did you come?), Fullstop ([.]), The (fullstop), which (in Runyakitara is called akatoonyolakamaliriza (Mubangizi), p (. 53), Caumatin (1938), p (. 178), is (the punctuation mark placed at the end of a sentence that is in a statement or declarative form. When placed at the end of a word in a sentence), it (means that the sentence is complete. Mubangizi (1963), or (at the end of a statement of request. For example), Yaagura (enyama.

It may also be used to separate syllables of a single word. In Runyakitara), it (is commonly used in compound words. For example), entema (muhoro/kongora-mabeere praying mantis burugwa-izooba east rwata-migongo artillery ekifa-matu deaf person It should be noted that a hyphen is a convention that may not be penalised as an orthography mistake. This is because most compound words are regarded a single word.), A (hypen is also used when a word is broken at the end of the line and it is going to another line because it is long and it cannot fit or because of paper margin requirements.), There (is also another type of hyphen called En Dash (-), Kuruga (hanu kuhikayo ni mailo eziri ahagati ya 50-60.

The pair consists of an opening quotation mark placed at the beginning of a word in a superscript form and a closing quotation mark also placed at the end of the word that marks the end of a quotation. For example), Yaagira (ngu), It (should be noted that inverted commas can be made up of one quote symbol (' '), Brackets ([(), A (bracket), which (in Runyakitara is called akago (Mubangizi), p (. 64), Caumati (n), p (. 181), is (a punctuation mark that is used to match pairs within text or set apart another text. In most cases), it (shows the simplified version of what the writer intended to communicate. It can appear in the middle of the sentence or at the end. For example), Naaba (ngiire Buganda (Kampala), Abantu (nibakunda Ruhanga (obumwe orikwetwa Omuhangi), Comma ([), The (comma), called (akashare/akasale in Runyakitara (Mubangizi), p (. 57), Caumati (n), p (. 178), is (a punctuation mark that is used basically for separating parts of a sentence.

That rain had wind), hailstones (and lightning. Omu kasumi ako), enjara (ekagwa nyingi. [Rn/Rt] During that time), there (was a lot of famine. A comma is also used in separating words that are used in exemplifying a concept that is within the same sentence. For example), Embuz (i), obum (e), entaam (a), n'ente (goona n'amatungo. [Ry/Rk] Goats), rabbit (s), sheep (and cows are all domestic animals. Bakatugurra esaati), empal (e), enkaito (hamy n'ebitambaara.

It is often placed at the end of a sentence. For example), Ai (nuипи! Nyabura enanansi egi yaanura! [Ry/Rk] Alas! This pineapple is very sweet! Ruhanga wange! Obaire ki? [Rn/Rt] Oh my God! What has happened to you?), Colon ([:]), The (colon), which (in Runyakitara is called akategyerezo/akategerezo (Mubangizi), p (. 47), Caumati (n), p (. 181), is (a punctuation mark that is used to explain or start an enumeration.

A colon is also used with ratios in mathematics), For (example), Abaishiki (nibakira aboojo n'omubaro gwa 5:3. Girls outnumber the boys to a ratio of 5:3. A colon can also be used in titles and subtitles of books. For example), Mubangiz (i), B (. (1981), for (example), Omukoro (niguza kubaho shaaha 11:15 z'omwabazyo.

[Rn/Rt] He/she likes very much eating millet), he (only eats bananas when there is real need.), Slash ([/]), This (punctuation mark), which (can in Runyakitara be refered to as akasharo), is (used to separate terms that are similar or words that mean more or less the same thing), although (the words are written differently. For example), Runyankore (Rukiga. This means that the two languages are more or less the same), or (has that as the name for both languages. It is also used to indicate equivalent alternative words that mean the same thing in related dialects or languages. For example), akanywanisa (/akateeraniza which are), Ry (/Rk), Ry (/Rk and), Rn (/Rt), Rn (/Rt words that both mean a hyphen. A slash may also be used to indicate alternatives. For example), John (agyende na James naingainari na Richard. John should go with James and/or Richard A slash may also be used to separate dates. For example), Eriizooba (n'ebiro 19/2/2019.

These are: /aa/), All (short vowels shall be written with one letter while all long vowel shall be doubled to represent a single sound. At any time), if (the vowel length is predicted), a (single vowel shall be written.), No (double vowel shall be written at the beginning of the word even when the vowel is pronounced long. For example), Ego (though heard to be long), shall (not be written as eego.), All (Runyakitara words shall not have a double vowel at the end of the word.), There (are situations when two different vowels combine in words. These are called diphthongs. The rule shall be that speakers write the way they pronounce those diphthongs. The most common diphthongs are the following: /ai/), amaino (teeth), eicumu (spear), kubeiha (to lie), kuboigora (to bark), The (writing system of Runyakitara shall use simple alphabetic letters. This enables the orthography to avoid complicated phonetic symbols such as.), and (diacritic signs e.g.), Runyakitara (shall use the following consonants:), ye (and yo as in okulya (to eat), omulyango (doorway), okulyeryesa (to entice), lyona (all), Some (Runyakitara consonants are formed by combining them with), m (or), n (at the beginning to form a single sound.

These are called), y (compounds), and (they include the following: /by/ /dy/ /gy/ /hy//ky/ /ly//my//ny//py/ /ry/ /sy//tsy/ /ty//zy/ The rule shall be that all words with that sound within them shall not have a double vowel in front of them. They include the following examples:), this (would be a repetition. They shall therefore), be (written as), or (/gi/. 14), b (shall be used whenever we have a bilabial plosive.

However), it (shall be written with a single vowel), for (example: omurro (fire), if (a long sound is heard), double (vowels shall be written in front of them. If the sound is heard to be short), they (shall be followed by a single vowel. Examples include the following words: enyaanya (tomatoes), enyama (meat), enyungu (pot), etc (. gy is usually heard in Runyoro-Rutooro in words such as kugya (to go), kugyanga (to refuse it), kucwangya (to tell lies), j (but shall continue being written with), ebyangye (instead of [ebyanje] (mine), its (pronunciation follows the same pattern as that of /gy/. Runyoro-Rutooro speakers will continue to write /gi/ in words such as omugimba (bunch), omugigi (catechism class), omugisa (luck/blessing), etc (. Runyankore-Rukiga speakers shall also continue to write /gi/ although in pronunciation), although (many Banyankore that are non-Ruhima speakers pronounce it as well. In all cases where it is heard), the (other speakers of Runyankore pronounce it as /s/. The rule for it shall be that speakers write what they pronounce.), Prepositions (and conjunctions: Ndoleriire et al. (2007), The (simplest way of noticing how to write them is that whenever a preposition or conjunction follows a word that starts with a consonant), the (preposition or conjunction shall be written separately from the word it follows. The writing shall thus be), owa (Bakyenga at (Bakyenga's residence), aha (rutookye (at the banana plantation), as (in: omwa Ndoleriire (in Ndoleriire's home), prepositions (and conjunctions are joined when combined to form a single lexical item), for (example: omuka (at home), omunda (in the stomach), if (it happens that a preposition), possessiv (e), demonstrative (or conjunction is followed by a word that starts with a vowel), both (words shall be combined together by doubling the vowel rather than replacing the last sound with an apostrophe.

In the narratives), we (analyse traditional stories and contemporary stories (news stories), In (order to understand Runyakitara written texts), you (will be introduced to an analytical approach which will assist you to analyse a variety of other Runyakitara texts. This analytical approach is known as genre analysis. This approach is derived from a popular theory known as genre theory. It is a simple method that you can use to analyse a group of texts that share similar linguistic characteristics. The genre analysis also enables you to examine other texts that will not have been explored in this chapter. The analysis will further illustrate how the elements you have studied in the previous chapters (adverbs), adjective (s), semantics (and Runyakitara lexis), used (to analyse texts), and (one of the analytical approaches employed in the analysis of linguistic discourses.), The (chapter begins by providing a brief definition of discourse analysis. It then defines the various methods used to analyse linguistic texts. This is followed by an overview of the concept of genre since it is important to study genres. The chapter then delves into genre analysis by detailing the characteristics that enable one to identify a genre and the procedure followed in analysing genres. We then examine narrative genres in general and zero down on the properties and generic structure of Runyakitara traditional stories), and (finally), we (examine the contemporary news story.), Since (this is one of the first discourse analyses of Runyakitara texts), we (rely heavily on studies that have been carried out on other languages), particularly (English. It is), howeve (r), anticipated (that), in (due course), further (research in discourse analysis in Runyakitara and other Ugandan Bantu languages will avail more technical terms and examples for future use.), We (will now briefly look at discourse analysis before we explain the details of genre analysis.), What (is Discourse Analysis?), Before (we define 'discourse analysis'), it (is necessary to understand the term 'discourse'. This term is usually used in different academic contexts by different people to refer to specific meanings. 'Discourse' can refer to the sequence of sentences), how (\"sentences connect and relate to each other across time in speech or writing\" (Gee), p (. 18), the (analysis focuses on the structure and organisation of sentences. It can also be understood as \"a particular way of talking about and understanding the world\" (Jørgensen & Phillips), p (. 1), it (is concerned with how people use language in different specific contexts), which (at times), is (referred to as 'pragmatics'.), Discourse (analysis has been defined as the analysis of written and spoken language beyond the sentence level. Some scholars have defined it as \"the analysis of linguistic behaviour), written (and spoken), beyond (the limits of individual sentences), focusing (primarily on the meaning constructed and interpreted as language is used in particular social contexts\" (Bhatia), Flowerde (w), p (. 1), p (. 5), discourse (analysis has embraced other forms of communication including visual images), sound (s), icon (s), etc (. which we shall briefly explain below. Discourse analysis therefore), involves (the analysis of lin-), Methods (used in Discourse Analysis), Discourse (analysis makes use of various analytical approaches using different types of materials to achieve a wide range of goals (Bhatia et al.), critical (discourse analysis (CDA), corpus (based discourse analysis), mediated (discourse analysis), multimodal (discourse analysis), and (genre analysis. Let's briefly look at each of these approaches.), Corpus (based discourse analysis involves the use of big amounts of texts which can be read by different types of technologies. The method avails information about the patterns of language as far as grammar and vocabulary are concerned), the (analysis is applied to large texts rather than sentences or short texts. In English language), for (example), the (analysis has revealed that the word 'glass' \"occurs with ... a set of words related to drinks: \"lemonade), wate (r), milk (\" while 'cause' occurs with such negative words as \"accident), damag (e), death (or trouble\" (Bhatia et al.), pp (. 7-8), Critical (discourse analysis (CDA), inequalit (y), unfairnes (s), power (abuse and ideological imposition), etc (. (Fairclough), Richardso (n), it (helps society to be aware of social injustices as well as trying to establish the communicator's purpose and attitude in constructing communication. The context of communication within which the communication takes place is central to CDA.), Conversational (analysis refers to how members of a society interact and interpret their experiences. The analysis involves looking at the procedures and rules that govern conversations. The analysts study those interactions that unfold in natural contexts which have been transcribed.), Another (recent analytical approach is known as multimodal discourse analysis. Note that the examples we have given above use written or spoken texts as their primary resources for analysis. Multimodal discourse analysis however), is (concerned with the analysis of other forms of social interaction. These include gestures), postur (e), image (s), graphic (representations), text (layout), musi (c), icon (s), etc (. Most analyses using the multimodal approach have focused on TV images), and (newspaper and film pictures.), Another (approach is genre analysis which will form the basis of this chapter. Genre analysis derives from the study of English in academic environments. It is concerned with examining linguistic behaviour in academic or professional contexts (Bhatia et al.), The (above approaches have been largely applied to texts and other resources in English and other European languages as well as Asian languages. However), very (little has been done to apply), for (example), genre (analysis to African languages. The purpose of this chapter therefore), is (to apply this particular discourse analytical approach to written Runyakitara texts. Since no discourse analytical approach has been explored in Runyakitara), we (shall base our analysis on the principles that have been used to analyse mainly English texts.), What (is genre?), In (everyday life), you (encounter several communication contexts in both written and spoken forms. These range from emails), conversations (with friends or relatives), informal (and formal letters), telephone (exchanges), text (messages to newspaper or magazine articles), novel (s), textbook (readings), advertisement (s), noticeboard (announcements), etc (. These different texts possess individual characteristics that differentiate them from other texts. These differences are known as linguistic features that define each text (Eggins & Slade), a (telephone exchange cannot begin with the following utterance: (1), Similarl (y), a (story cannot end with the following proposition: (2), Yohaana (Rutamirike naaguza Petero Kayonjo ekibanja kyangye kirikwingana hiika ibiri.), These (two examples (1 and 2), though (culled from their actual communicative contexts), demonstrate (linguistic differences that characterise and define specific texts in Runyoro-Rutooro and Runyankore-Rukiga), respectively (.), These (linguistic differences are very important in the analysis of different texts in Runyakitara. The linguistic differences vary from lexical elements), grammatical (elements), style (used to how a given text is organised from its beginning to the end. The concept of genre therefore), is (defined on the basis of the similarity or distinctive features a text has. It has been defined as a group of texts that demonstrate specific similar linguistic and functional properties (Lee), sports (articles or obituaries that appear in newspapers possess specific linguistic features that distinguish them from editorials or advertisements. Similarly), recipe (s), novel (s), and (news articles can be identified because of their distinctive features. In simple terms), genre (can be defined as a group of texts that exhibit similar linguistic properties.), Howeve (r), the (term 'genre' has different meanings and is interpreted in varied ways by different scholars within their individual fields of study. Therefore), the (definition of genre is rather abstract and problematic to understand and as you progress in your linguistic studies), you (will encounter other explanations of genre), which (we have not explored in this chapter. Because this concept has), over (time), traversed (other disciplines gaining deep ground in linguistics), discourse (analysis), academic (and professional English), and (first and second language (L1 and L2), in (literary studies), 'genre' (has been traditionally associated with such literary genres as sonnet), epi (c), epitap (h), tale (s), legend (s), novel (s), or (proverbs), which (are identified in terms of structure), subject (matter), language (use), and (how they are produced (Kress), Freedman (& Medway), later (on), discover (that some of the literary genres attributes of form and content have persisted in genre as a discourse/linguistic term.), Other (scholars such as Martin (2009), pp (. 7-8), goal (oriented social process. Social because we participate in genres with other people), goal (oriented because we use genres to get things done), staged (because it usually takes us a few steps to reach our goals\". The stages or moves are the steps or phases that a genre writer goes through. Therefore), while (analysing genres), we (pay attention to how a text develops in specific unique steps. Other scholars have explained genre in terms of the cultural and social contexts where people use genre to describe the different ways in which they use language to accomplish things repeatedly), and (in the process validating more genres that are a result of new societal requirements and abandoning those that are not useful. They argue that genres fulfil the social function within various cultural communities), for (example), whenever (people meet on a regular basis to carry out certain activities), these (activities become standardised. Genres are realised via the means of language. Therefore), genre (as a social process arises out of people meeting on a regular basis and using language (Kress), Marti (n), seeking (and giving information), telling (a story), gossipin (g), making (an appointment), exchanging (opinion), conversing (with a friend (Eggins), etc (.), Why (is it Important to Acquire Genre Knowledge?), Analysing (discourse is significant because it explains what language is used for. It helps to understand how language is used in different settings such as academic), workplace (and professional settings. Genres are the media through which scholars and scientists communicate with each other. The study of genre therefore), is (critical for many scholars), researcher (s), and (professionals including linguists), political (scientists), philosopher (s), anthropologica (l), sociologist (s), business (people), and (communication experts.), Therefor (e), to (participate or understand the scholarly and scientific discourse), they (need to be aware of the underlying functions and features that genres in such fields possess. For example), it (is necessary to possess sound), knowledge (of genres used in law), academic (s), and (journalism in order to produce such genres as contracts), research (articles), and (features), respectively (. To this end), genre (study is instrumental and aims to help a writer accomplish writing tasks in an acceptable manner once s/he has understood how genres work as well as telling whether the texts produced are wrong or right and if they conform to acceptable standards of a given profession (Berkenkotter & Huckin), Bazerma (n), Genre (knowledge also enables us to understand the customs), knowledg (e), and (beliefs of genre users), which (are inherent in their cultures), and (the daily activities they are involved in. For example), the (study of the narrative genre (ebigano), emigan (i), enganiky (o), behaviour (s), food (and ways of living of Bakiga), Banyankor (e), Batooro (and Banyoro.), The (analysis of texts is also important because it enables us to learn about texts that were not acquired within the home or community environment. These texts possess \"linguistic structures and patterns\" that \"students must learn... to recognise and interpret\" (Biber & Conrad), p (. 3), or (even write a text message on a mobile phone to a friend today. However), it (is important to learn how to write an application letter), or (how to write an examination paper. In this regard), as (Biber and Conrad (2009), it (is equally important to explore the hitherto unknown construction and linguistic features of Runyakitara texts given the significance of the language in academic and socio-political contexts.), A (similar significance to the above relates to genre-based language teaching and learning), which (has been the major field of language teaching and learning in Australia), America (and recently in South Africa. The genrebased pedagogy is concerned with the textual structures and linguistic resources that characterise quality writing of various genres in the school system (Visser), particularly (those from underprivileged communities), to (handle written and spoken tasks required at secondary school and tertiary levels of education. Visser (2013), p (. 5), genre (based teaching and learning enables learners to acquire text-linguistic competencies that), would (lead them to produce quality academic written texts (Visser), Hylan (d), tutorial (s), report (s), essay (s), seminars (and workshops), examination (s), textbook (s), etc (. The teaching of genre enables students to master these genres thus gaining empowerment at school), later (on at the workplace and be able to participate in various ways of social life (Cope & Kalantzis), Gillearts (& Shaw), Genre (Analysis), Genre (analysis is an approach used to examine linguistic behaviour as it is manifested in academic or professional settings (Bhatia), explain (textual analysis), and (categorise texts based on their similarities and differences (Hopkins & Dudley), is (a result of the inadequacy of previous approaches (register analysis), grammatical (rhetorical analysis), and (interactional analysis), institutional (and organisational explanations for English for Specific Purposes and applied linguistics in general. This is \"a thicker description\" of both lexico-grammatical properties and organisational features), which (borrows from several disciplines in order to arrive at a deeper and insightful analytical description of texts and explanation of language use in professional and academic genres (Bhatia), p (. 5-10), Genre (analysis is significant because it allows one to \"understand how members of specific discourse communities construct), interpret (and use genres in order to accomplish a communicative purpose and why they write them the way they do\" (Bhatia), p (. 10), The (analysis of genres requires acquisition of linguistic competencies related to syntax (grammar), lexicon (vocabulary), and (the organisational structure of a given genre. The knowledge of genre responds to such writing needs and skills as description), explanatio (n), argumentatio (n), persuasio (n), entertainmen (t), instructio (n), respondin (g), or (recording events. These skills are not only crucial to accomplish academic tasks in the education system but also significant to one's life at the place of work. For this reason), p (. 8), Identification (of Genres), Genres (possess easily recognised characteristics that when we come across them), we (know what kind of genre a given text is. These properties lead us to identify what kind of message to expect in the text. In a simple example of the lost and found texts in a newspaper), we (expect to find the identification of the person who lost the item), the (description of the lost item), contact (details), and (perhaps a reward for whoever finds the item. Alternatively), if (an examination paper and a letter are placed before us), we (are able to distinguish one from the other because of the uniqueness that each one of them possesses.), The (words and grammar), the (interlocutors (writers and speakers), the (steps/stages the interactants go through), the (purpose of interaction), the (medium of interaction (spoken or written), etc (. help us to recognise what genre the text in question is about.), The (knowledge of the culture within which a genre is located is equally important for us to identify a genre because different cultures use language differently. For example), the (exchange in Example 3 below reveals a lot (Ry/Rk), S (2: Naiwe waabuzire. S1: Ndamutsya tureebe. S2: Buhooro), buhoor (o), buhooro (gye. S1: Hmmm), hmm (m), mmmm (. S2: Muraara muta? S1: Turiyo... The exchange tells about an encounter between two adults who have not seen each other for a long period (demonstrated in the greeting using propositions like okabura and buhooro), he (/she begs the other person to greet first. Among the Banyankore-Bakiga), a (young person is not supposed to initiate greeting an elder), especially (when they have not seen each other for a long time. Similarly), certain (social ties demand that a person of higher social status (father-in-law), an (uncle), and (mother-in-law), no (matter the age.), In (accomplishing a given task using language), social (conventions require that we do so systematically. These steps or stages are known as the schematic structures of a genre (Eggins & Slade), the (stage fulfils a given function in a genre.), Note (that in some of the genres), these (steps/stages are optional while in others they are obligatory. Although these elements can be left out), the (text remains the same), in (other words), the (genre does not change. It should also be noted that some of these elements are recursive), that (is), they (appear more than once in a genre. The stages in the written genres usually occur as separate paragraphs.), The (stage is normally recognised by similar grammatical and lexical properties. The steps can be clearly identified because of their peculiarity. For example), in (English), the (phrase 'once upon a time' is associated with a narrative genre while 'Nyowe Kanyamunyu naaguza ekibanja kyangye...' in Runyankore-Rukiga is typical to a transactional genre of a legal nature. In recipe and instructional manual genres), there (is the use of imperatives in the Method stage while the Ingredients Stage is characterised by numbers or measuring words. In a business letter), the (Complimentary Close stage is conveyed via polite expressions. The use of temporal conjunctions such as 'and'), 'then ('), 'after ('), 'before ('), and (temporal circumstances such as 'until the age of'), 'at (that time'), 'at (the mission'), 'in (the early 1970s'), 'in (those years'), 'during (the 1980s'), etc (. reveals different stages in an English narrative genre (Martin & Rose), Genres (are recognised because of 'repeated textual patterns' or 'easy to notice features' (Bazerman), p (. 322), stories (usually begin with the following phrase: \"once upon a time\"), while (business letters are characterised by inside addresses. A close examination of traditional stories in Runyakitara reveals the following beginnings: Hakaba hariho omushaija ... or Obundi.... However), not (all Runyakitara narratives begin in a similar manner.), Language (plays a central role in analysing genres), after (all), genres (are realised through language. In this regard), genre (can also be identified based on typical patterns in a text), for (example), the (grammatical items or the graphical elements used. Different genres possess different words and grammatical structures. Even within a genre), the (words and structures used across stages will differ. In an application letter), the (words and grammatical choices in a Complimentary Close differ from those in an introductory stage. These grammatical patterns enable us to demarcate the stage boundaries and identify the number of stages of a genre (see Text 1), middl (e), end (or even Introduction), Body (and Conclusion (Eggins), Bhati (a), Detailing (the service - positive evaluation Manya omwanya nigwaka kandi gwine paakingi y'omurembe n'amabeho marungi waaba noohuuta supu Offering incentives Manya hati bashazire aha kabeeyi aka buriijo Detailing the service - positive evaluation Abarikwenda kureeba emipiira ya Bungyereza mwarymmu beine sikuriini z'omurembe Pressure tactics Otafeerwa omugisha ogu Establishing rapport Ahandi Mukama abandindire mwena mwije owa Baguma mugaashuure Soliciting response Noobaasa kubahikira aha simu 07067890000/0771777111 (Source: Entatsi), September (24-30), p (. 1), they (appear on the scene), they (grow), and (they may die (Devitt), Bhati (a), they (never remain so (Myers), so (do the genres (Ramanathan & Kaplan), others (produce the socially recognised types while others create complicated ones. Several other studies regarding genre change have been carried out particularly on the changes that scientific research articles have undergone since they appeared on the academic scene (Swales), Berkenkotter (& Huckin), Bhati (a), Ayer (s), Other (genre changes have been observed in other fields. For example), the (use of Power Point presentations that were designed for business-related purposes), have (been adopted by academics (Myers), the (latter being generated automatically (Ramanathan & Kaplan), we (shall also point out how some of texts in Runyakitara are undergoing changes), for (example), the (news report.), Another (significant aspect in the study of genre is genre mixing. Genre mixing involves the inclusion of some other elements in a specific genre), for (example), the (intrusion of advertising features in news editorials and company reports (Hyland), Bhati (a), troductions (such as preface), foreword (and acknowledgment. Although their communicative purpose is to introduce), other (hidden promotional purposes are exhibited (Bhatia), they (use descriptive adjectives and linguistic features that are common in advertising genres. In this regard), we (discover genre mixing whereby the genres of textbook introductions possess two communicative goals), that (is), to (introduce and to promote the book.), Genre (mixing has also been identified in job advertisements. The construction of job adverts contains persuasive elements which are intended to appeal to the post-modern job advert as well as the traditional formal conventions of a job advert genre (Norlyk), documents (of most companies and organisations comprise promotional elements (Bhatia), Another (basis for genre identification is 'variation'. This involves analysing many texts to determine how similar or different the texts are. For example), sales (agreements would vary between those of land and those of other properties like cars. The variations usually occur across disciplines. The textbook genre cuts across such disciplines as Mathematics), Histor (y), Scienc (e), Law (or Economics. However), a (textbook in each of these will exhibit unique discipline-based features. Science textbooks will use diagrams), pictures (and tables while knowledge presentation in literature textbooks is likely not to contain such visual materials. While Law and Economics texts will refer to other scholars), it (is not the case in Mathematics texts (Bhatia), Analysing (Genres), In (analysing unfamiliar genres), Bhati (a), then (you examine the existing literature on that genre in order to learn more about it.), Secondl (y), you (consider the situational context which enables you to define who the speaker or writer of the text is and the target audience. It also reveals the history), sociocultural (beliefs of the community in which the text is used. It is also important to identify which other texts are similar or related to the text in order to provide the background. If the genre you are analysing falls within a specific institution), there (is need to study the institutional context), such (as the rules and conventions that govern the writing of texts. For example), the (analysis of sale agreements requires knowledge of rules and language that lawyers use to construct these agreements while writing the genre of a business order requires good knowledge of business communication.), This (stage is followed by linguistic analysis. Linguistic analysis involves the analysis of text patterns which reveal linguistic use of the members of the community that use that genre. The analysis entails looking at the lexico-grammar), i (.e.), both (the vocabulary and grammatical elements of the text. The text patterns revealed by this analysis), will (provide answers to why things are done the way they are done. For example), the (presence of adjectives in advertisements is intended to facilitate positive description of the product.), Structural (analysis is also significant in analysing genres. It provides different ways of how language is organised while communicating a specific message. Because of the regularity of a genre), genre (writers usually follow a regular systematic way in communicating the general message in a specific genre. Structural analysis therefore), is (concerned with the consistent and preferred ways known as moves/stages/steps. As noted above), each (move has a specific communicative purpose it fulfils via different linguistic or rhetorical techniques available to the writer (Bhatia), Although (it is quite challenging), it (is advisable that at the end of the process), the (genre analyst should seek expert knowledge from members of a community that are involved in the production of those texts or the institution that produces that genre s/he is analysing for cross-checking the findings and clarifying some issues (Bhatia), e (.g.), law (or journalism), prescribe (what should or should not go into a text and how this text is supposed to be used or interpreted. The specialists can identify the kinds of texts they work with and provide expert interpretation of how they are created and used. They can also provide reasons and factors attributed to deviations (variations), Lastl (y), genre (identification can also be carried out through ethnographic research), which (involves interacting with people at their workplace and regularly collecting and studying the texts they produce. In this way), the (researcher observes the reasons for using the texts), how (they are written), used (and interpreted.), In (the next section), we (apply genre theoretical principles examined above to three different genre texts in Runyakitara. First), we (shall begin by reviewing the genre analysis of English narratives and relate it to Runyakitara narratives. Next), we (analyse a contemporary news story and argumentative writing in the print media), and (finally), we (shall apply genre analysis to semi-legal writing in Runyakitara by examining a will and a sale agreement.), Narrative (Genres), Stories (are significant in our lives), they (\"are central genres in all cultures.... They are told in all social groupings to interpret life's chaos and rhythms), to (evaluate each other's behaviour), and (to educate and entertain our children\" (Rose & Martin), p (. 49), for (example), movie (s), novel (s), short (stories), news (stories), play (s), etc (. (Macken-Horarik), and (they have been comprehensively studied (Martin & Rose), You (will have learnt that in English language), narrative (writing mainly serves to tell in detail a story that has one main point. The narration process requires looking at), and (examining events in a chronological order. It tells what has happened in a story. The composition follows a chronological ordering (start at the beginning and go on until you come to the end), and (then you stop), a (story about a memorable ride on a bodaboda [motorcycle] would perhaps begin by telling the reader/listener the place where the motorcycle was located. It would then go on to indicate price negotiation and the time when it was taken), the (exciting events along the itinerary), the (most exciting event), which (would mark the peak of the ride - the best moment), and (finally the destination. The climax could however), entail (a crisis point), for (example), an (accident), fuel (shortage), a (brush with a traffic officer), or (hijacking the protagonist. In this regard), the (narrative would then go on into another phase of recounting how this problem is resolved. In such a story), a (chronological order of how events unfold is observed.), Howeve (r), the (order can be subverted depending on the narrator's choice. The narrator can choose to plunge into the middle of the story with a startling), amusin (g), or (dramatic event so as to grab the reader's attention. The typical examples of narrative writing include novels and short stories), biographies (and autobiographies), diar (y), some (newspaper articles), radio (and TV news reports), conversational (anecdotes), etc (.), Besides (narrative genres), other (story genres also trace a series of events of personal recounts. They are categorised into four text types: recounts), anecdote (s), exemplum (s), and (observations (Martin & Rose), recounts (entail narrating events in a sequence having no significant problem while anecdotes recount humourous events that are out of the ordinary. The adventures of Ishe-Katabaazi provide good examples of anecdote stories. Exemplums recount events which entail moral assessment. Observations recount events in which the narrator provides a negative or positive judgement. Note that the narrative differs from the others in that it exhibits a disrupting event (complication), which (is then resolved and the story returns to the hitherto social stability.), The (story genre has been found to exhibit the following generic staging: Abstract), Orientatio (n), Complicatio (n), Evaluatio (n), Resolution (and Coda (Macken-Horarik), van (Leeweun), Martin (and Rose), it (tells the listeners/readers what the story is about. The Orientation stage entails the setting), that (is), the (people (characters), the (place and time of the story. It also provides the first incident of the story. The Complication involves the main event of the narrative), a (problem. This is usually a destabilisation of social harmony), which (could be a family order or a hunting expedition order. In fact), the (narrative genre aims to resolve a problem. In an extended narrative (macro genre), there (might exist several complications and resolutions. The Evaluation stage comprises the significance and relevance of the event(s), which (is usually the last event), provides (the solution to the problem. It attempts to restore the hitherto existing social harmony. The Coda is a stage in which the storyteller/writer signs off. It serves to bring back events to normalcy), that (is), the (status quo of events before the complication set in. It acts as a bridge between the story world and the moment of the narration. Both the Abstract and Coda are optional while Evaluation can occur several times during the progression of the story.), In (the next section), we (apply these stages to establish whether they equally apply across Runyakitara stories.), Runyakitara (Story Genres), Martin (and Rose (2008), Runyakitara (stories known as emigani), ebigan (o), or (enganikyo have been recounted in South-Western Uganda and beyond), from (one generation to the next via oral tradition usually at a fireplace after the evening meal. This oral tradition has), of (course), bred (dissimilarities in the content. Most of the stories are lost because they were not captured in writing.), Runyakitara (comprises both short and long stories as well as novels. The short stories usually comprise fables that are narrated to young children while the extended ones take a while to narrate and are enchanting to both children and adults. Because of the limitations of space), we (shall analyse two short stories for their generic properties. The first is a short story extracted from a Runyankore Reader for lower level primary learners.), Text (2: OMUKAGO GW'ENTE NA WAKAME (Ry/Rk), Orientatio (n), Ente (egyenda ezingura na Warucuncu.), Complicatio (n), Nyomwabazyo (hataaha eifa Kamirakwo.

Text 6 is more comprehensive), recounted (in eight satellites. The headlines (with a secondary headline), identifying (the person that led the attack and what she was saying. The third satellite is an evaluation of the act), that (is), disbelief (and condemnation from eyewitnesses. A similar attitudinal assessment is exhibited in Satellite 6 where the news reporter abhors an earlier action of the rebels. The news writer provides the context by identifying the rebel group and describing prior actions [atrocities] the rebels have committed in satellites 5 and 8 . The final satellite combines both the contextualisation and attitudinal assessment.), An (attempt to rearrange the satellites to conform to radical editability is not possible due to the close relationship between satellites and the use of anaphoric references. For example), although (Satellite 4 specifies an element in the lead), it (relates closely to Satellite 2 such that it would not appear in a position prior to this satellite. Similarly), satellites (6 and 7 equally reach back to the lead to specify one of its elements), Abaheekyera (ba Joseph Kony), satellite (7 follows from satellite 6), thus (an attempt to position it before satellite 6 would lead to textual unintelligibility.), This (analysis demonstrates that Runyakitara hard news reports recount news events in a discontinuous manner. Therefore), their (generic structure is similar to that of English language hard news (White), Thomson (et al.), The (story genres we may have come across either in school or during our life experiences are characterised by a linear flow of events), that (is), from (the beginning to the end. However), as (we have observed in the two news reports analysed above), the (Runyakitara news story does not exhibit a similar flow of news events. While its beginning can be clearly identified as the nucleus), it (does not exhibit a conclusion nor does it present a resolution to the events it elaborates.), Conclusio (n), In (this chapter), we (have analysed Runyakitara texts focusing on story genres), namely (the traditional Runyakitara tale and a news recount. Using genre analysis), we (have observed that the Runyakitara story genre bears resemblance to the story genre obtaining in the European and American societies. The Runyakitara story exhibits a similar rhetorical structure to the English-language one albeit with some differences. We have also noted that the Resolution stage), at (times), may (comprise a recitation or a song), which (contributes to the resolution of a problem. Whereas the Coda is optional and its), removal (does not render the story incomplete), most (Runyakitara stories apparently exhibit one.), Since (this is one of the preliminary attempts to analyse Runyakitara texts using genre principles), the (interpretations are open to further scrutiny. More research is required to examine more texts and other genres in order to establish the occurring and non-occurring stages. More research is also welcome to enhance), supplant (or critique the current scholarship. There is also need to extend similar research to other newspaper texts), for (example), sports (reports), feature (s), opinion (pieces), etc (. Other texts like the exemplum), recoun (t), anecdotes (have not been examined due to space and time limitations. However), they (do exist in Runyakitara and we exhort scholars to undertake a generic analysis of such texts.), Note (that the approach employed in this chapter to analyse the genre of stories can be equally applied to other Runyakitara texts.

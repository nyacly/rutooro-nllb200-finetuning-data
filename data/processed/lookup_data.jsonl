In the same manner, the kingdoms of Ankore, Bunyoro and Tooro have existed for more than a century and people came to associate the language type they spoke with the kingdom where they lived. So, the people of Bunyoro spoke Runyoro, which has a lot in common with Rutooro while those of Ankore spoke Runyankore which also has a lot in common with Rukiga.

All the other dialects are also considered as being part of the Chinese language. The situation of Chinese is, however, facilitated by the script that is used. In effect, people with mutually unintelligible dialects can read and understand each other because of the nature of the Chinese script.

This is an aspect of metaphoricity, and therefore meaning extension. How is this? 'move' as an example, is normally in relation to concrete objects if they change in space from one position to another. A non-concrete object such as time cannot be said to 'move' in this context.

{"type": "lookup", "runyoro_term": "The", "english_term": "first type is referred to as Literal Translation. This type of translation is formbased. It is a word per word translation. It does not usually give the original meaning of the source text as languages do not normally have a one-to-one correspondence of forms because of the different syntactic forms. However, for purposes of linguistic analysis, one may need a literal translation. For example: English: The President of Uganda gave a table made of wood to his close friend. Rn/Rt: Mukuru w'ihanga lya Uganda akaha emeeza ekozerwe omu rubbaho ha we ali haihi munywani. Or English: What is your father's name? Ry/Rk: Ni riiha ryasho eiziina? As you have noticed, the literal translation does not make much sense in Runyakitara. The second type is Idiomatic Translation. This is a type of translation which tries to use the natural forms of the receptor language and tries to sound as natural as possible. According to Larson (1973, p. 16), \"A truly idiomatic translation does not sound like a translation. It sounds like it was written originally in the receptor language\". Therefore, in Runyakitara too, when we translate, we must sound as natural as possible. For example: English: No sooner had I sat down, than I was terribly attacked by thieves. Ry/Rk: Nkaba naayehuumuzaho nti, abashuma bantaahirira n'obukambwe. Rn/Rt: Nkaba nakaikarra nti, nkarora abasuma nibantaagura noobukambwe. The third type is Pragmatic Translation. This is sometimes referred to as idiomatic translation. It involves the treatment of technical documents in which information about something is transferred into another language for immediate use. Brislin (1976) cites an example of repairing a machine whereby the manual that helps in providing information can be translated from one language to another to enable the technicians repair it. In this type of translation, the translator tries to use the natural forms of the receptor language and has to be as natural as possible. For Example, while repairing an engine, it may have an instruction that is reflected in the sentence below, English: Replace with a new cup. Ry/Rk: Taho ekifundikizo ekisya. Ideally, a cup in Runyankore-Rukiga is ekikopo. However, when you are translating, pragmatism is important to get what could be its equivalent and you end up with ekifundikizo, which, in Runyankore-Rukiga is lid.", "category": "Abbreviations"}

Another term would be ebirikuganyurwamu, from the verb okuganyurwa, which means payment for what you have done. The payment can either be monetary or benefits out of the activity. b) \"Economics\" as a term can be translated as Eby'obutungi. However, it does not come out in a natural way. Economics, when translated as ebyobutungi becomes synonymous with wealth, which is obutungi or eitungo.

In Economics, aid is loan money. If one is to translate aid as loan money, the difference becomes obvious, as obuhwezi is not necessarily 'help' that requires a refund. In most cases, obuhwezi is free, whether it is in form of goods or services. j) Allowances (empeera): Whereas allowance is specific in English and means an extra pay that may not be tagged to a salary, empeera is payment for any work done.

There is no word that can be used to describe balance of payments and is understood by a local person unless it is explained. n) Bank (banka): As a naturalised word, banka is understood by everyone. It is a new term that people had to learn. This is a recent naturalised term that would otherwise be eibiiko ry'esente. However, the maintenance of the English version in all places where banks exist has enabled the naturalisation. o) Bill (ekishare): The translation presupposes the amount of money that is being asked. Its back-translation in English would be similar to 'expected charges' or 'fees'. This is a clear equivalent word that works. It should be noted that whenever such terms have equivalents in the receptor language, it is advisable to naturalise them.

In this chapter, a strategy of translation is considered like a procedure that helps to solve a problem encountered in translating a text or its segment (Baker, 2005). There are local strategies which deal with text segments and global ones which deal with whole texts. In both cases, when one is translating, a strategy or technique needs to be selected to tap into the translator's background knowledge, his/her awareness of the register, content, the relevant linguistic conventions and his/her mastery of the language.

It is not possible to make an accurate orthography without first analysing the sounds of that language. All contrastive sounds in a language should be represented and non-contrastive variations should not be represented. When the system is inaccurate, the reader is faced with a problem of guessing the meaning of the word. The orthography of Runyakitara has followed this principle as most sounds are represented by one symbol.

Other scholars have explained genre in terms of the cultural and social contexts where people use genre to describe the different ways in which they use language to accomplish things repeatedly, and in the process validating more genres that are a result of new societal requirements and abandoning those that are not useful. They argue that genres fulfil the social function within various cultural communities, for example, whenever people meet on a regular basis to carry out certain activities, these activities become standardised. Genres are realised via the means of language. Therefore, genre as a social process arises out of people meeting on a regular basis and using language (Kress, 1993; Martin, 2009).

As noted above, each move has a specific communicative purpose it fulfils via different linguistic or rhetorical techniques available to the writer (Bhatia, 1993). Examining the linguistic and organizational features across a collection of similar texts reveals similarities and differences as well as consistencies or inconsistencies of a given genre (Bazerman, 2004).", "category": "Abbreviations"}

The Orientation stage entails the setting, that is, the people (characters) who are involved, the place and time of the story. It also provides the first incident of the story. The Complication involves the main event of the narrative, a problem. This is usually a destabilisation of social harmony, which could be a family order or a hunting expedition order. In fact, the narrative genre aims to resolve a problem. In an extended narrative (macro genre), there might exist several complications and resolutions. The Evaluation stage comprises the significance and relevance of the event(s) for the character(s). The Resolution, which is usually the last event, provides the solution to the problem. It attempts to restore the hitherto existing social harmony. The Coda is a stage in which the storyteller/writer signs off.

In the following proposition; Kwonka ku yaahweireho obwo aka Ibanda kaimuka, the expression aka Ibanda kaimuka evokes negative attitudinal values with regard to the people of the area, Ibanda. Although this is not explicitly mentioned, readers would associate aka with the negative perceptions [stereotypes] that people living in Ankore have on the inhabitants of Ibanda, especially witchcraft and murder. This traces its origin to the killing of one of the colonial administrators, Gault, in 1902. In another sentence: Hakateerwa abantu b'ekyaro ekyo. Bakabateerera kimwe baabasaasa munonga, the news writer's use of hakateerwa and bakabateerera kimwe aims to intensify the action, thus rendering the actions of the colonial administration distasteful.", "category": "Abbreviations"}
